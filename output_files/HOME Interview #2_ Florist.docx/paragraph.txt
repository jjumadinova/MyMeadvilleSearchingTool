So, I guess. Did you grow up in Meadville?

R: In crawford county, not Meadville.

Okay. Did you ever come to Meadville during your childhood?

R: Yes.

Do you remember anything distinct? I know I have been listening to a lot of interviews and people have been saying it used to be this, it used to be that. Are there distinct things that you remembered and enjoyed?

R: Specifically Meadville?

Yes, specifically Meadville, if you can.

R: I guess there was a lot more downtown stores. We had sidewalk sales, you know I remember that from my childhood. Coming to sidewalk sales, and walking up and down chestnut street. But, I don’t know.

So, do you live in Meadville now? Or, do you just come to the Market House and sell pretty flowers?

R: No.

Have you ever had a interesting customer? Experience? Or thing you witnessed on this street?

R: Well,  one of my customers moved to Alaska and then when he visits Meadville he buys flowers.

Wow, that’s impressive.

R: There are a lot of good customers.

Do you feel like there is a sense of community here?

R: Oh ya, I think a lot of people come to the Market House to socialize, go eat, and visit. It is a destination where people meet. They’ll say let’s meet at the Market House. Especially, on Saturdays when it’s busy, and it’s not busty now.

So, do you know all about flowers I assume you do?

R: No, I it is one of those things where I am still learning. There is always questions, somebody always has a question. I don’t know. There was one vendor who used to come and he would bring a book and he studied it and he knew if somebody had a question he would refer to it. But, he sold hers and other things too. I have (?). A lot of times people tell me, what they do with their fruits and vegetables.

They help you!

R: Right!

I guess, last question, if you could offer a piece of advice for the youth of Meadville, what would it be?

R: Smile.

That’s a good piece of advice!

“Stop and smell the flowers”
