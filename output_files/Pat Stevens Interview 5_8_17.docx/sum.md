**excerpts:**
Meadville is the most special place in the world to me . The question is sot of asking It ’s a deep feeling . A character in the motion picture Field of Dreams summed it up best “

I was born and raised in Meadville . I made a conscious choice to come back after college because it mattered more to me to be here than it did what I would be doing here . Even when I eventually retire , I will stay in Meadville .
More viable retail downtown . A men ’s clothing store . A true department store . Not a Wal Mart . More varied restaurants . Being able to buy the majority of needed goods and service downtown .
Parades and gatherings downtown ... A memorial Day observance that attracts hundreds of people and concerts in Diamond Park . Small town America at it Small independent business which add character and flavor to our town .
Diamond Park . Market House . It ’s not one thing , Meadville is n’t one thing . Meadville is a collection of churches , stores , offices , arts , people who make them all thrive .
Our sense of history and place of time . You can not move forward without understanding the history which brought you to where you are now .
How the community is a whole , and how everyone works together to make it better . And how nobody is left out in our community , everybody is friends with everybody .
Most every problem we face as a community can be solved with talents of those who are already here . We must put our resources and hard work into what we value and not wait for someone close to do it .
