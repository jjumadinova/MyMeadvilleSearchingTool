**excerpts:**
Merry Lee Melis . the different activities were available for families . We used to come down to the Halloween Parade and park their by the Academy Theater and then climb up on top of the car so we could see and we would hangout and watch the parade when we were younger . But , the Academy Theater always had movies and there was a group that moved up to the Odd Fellows building that did plays in the community theater .
I am Joyce Aredneck and I am not form here but I have lived in the area for a little more that 20 years almost a little over 21 years Different activities like Marry eluded too .
These are rural Appalachian town Meadville and Gadez , typically of borderline Midwestern communities . They were muddy make shift foot hill cities at the turn of the century , dewy in the spring , snowy in the winter , and muggy hot in the summer .
And , this book has not been circulated , well it circulated six years ago . and he spent his younger years here Especially about being here , I cam here 25 , what 26 years ago
Well , I lived my whole life in Erie , I went to school in Erie , well I was born in Cleveland but I spent most of my elementary and college career in Erie . but I was working at the Erie library and
My husbands job brought me to the area , we live by Cambridge Springs , then I saw the add in the paper and that 's why I came to Meadville I applied for the job .
He ran the tape through the machine that took the coils and made the teeth for the zipper , and I could to go on take your kid to work day one day , and I got to see the machine that he ran .
I am Cindy Aims , I grew up here , I went to Sagertown . I only lived 5 or 6 miles out of town so I was always coming here and I just decided to stick around , creature of habit .
And , you would be surprised how many people come up to me and say are n't you that guy from the library , I like the level that I can go out and people know me , so ?

you had the Talloon plant , they made artificial fibers at the viscos plant , and so on and so on there was the TNT , where they stored the TNT not to far from here down by Atlanta
We always called that the TNT because my mom lived in one of those 0909 after the war . And , there was a lot of farming in this area a lot of different   groups of people with the Mennonites and the Amish and we have one of the larger African American communities in Crawford County in town . So , we have some variety too
did n't think twice about it and then he heard the radio broadcast from the Ortion Mercury theater here .
So , my Aunt was a teacher in one of the local schools , like I said their were jobs for a long time here so people did not really need to go hunting around for jobs .
Probably , because he helped found one of the local volunteer fire departments , so he volunteered that way . He did not belong to any social clubs but there have been a lot of them who have been in town in Lions and the Elks and what not .
Ya , the Italian civic center and all those different clubs that people could belong to if they wanted to there 's lots of different kinds of churches in the area . So , when my brother wanted to go to the Baptist Church there was one for him , they were Presbyterians . They took us to the Baptist Church if that was were we wanted to go because there were choices .
It does n't take too long to drive out of town and within a few miles you can be in the woods and and I had like 20 different bird varieties outside my house .
It 's something I really like since I was a kid we always went camping ...
Not really we were on route 98 so it did n't feel like we were in nature , but we went camping a lot . And , I always spent a lot of times in the woods . Just wandering around1224 .
and it kind of nice . so I do n't miss any of that . But , I like being close to nature too I take my grandkids there to do that now .
Big yard ! And there are trees time , and a swamp to go swamping in . All that start of stuff , and a fire haul to wake you up , it 's very exciting !
You know I am going to Chicago this weekend and maybe I will walk around with a sign on my chest that says that I have a backyard .
The Market House .
Just because it feels like a central hub for activity and there 's vendors and Second Saturday , there is always something going on down there .
We used to have a drum circle and there were a couple times where we did drumming along with Couty Harris 's Tai-chi group and that was a lot of fun .
I think I would say the fairgrounds , the Crawford County Fair Grounds because not only is the fair the big thing up there but there are lots of other things that go there or come into town .
and he had all of these cowboy hats , and he asked us or name and we were talking to him and he 's working with a bottle of glue writing our names on these cowboy hats and then putting glitter on it , and
it 's like you leave on the last Saturday in September and then last Saturday in August and it 's like the same thing , it does n't change , everything is always in the same spot . All the vendors are in the same spot .
ight , haha .
it 's just . and we had the Pancake Palace up there for many years , and we actually spent , we would start getting it ready in June and we would be up there you know two nights a week from June all the way to September .
We used to go to Conneaut Lake park all the time
That 's the thing with this town is that everybody talks about cuts and cutting back and doing more with less I am . We did n't cut things and cut and cut and cut . I think if we do that we will be much better off .
There is less community involvement then there was in my youth . Fewer people volunteering , fewer people stepping up and taking leadership positions , and I 'm not sure people would n't still do that or nobody 's approached them in the right way or ...
Every business that did business in this town belonged to a service club or something , and that was payed by the businesses . And have the records show that John Bryce is a graduate from Gannon University in the class of accounting .
I know we have the Make A Difference Day
If you could see ya I worked on that , I helped clean up the Diamond Park after a storm . And , they worked all day on it and that ramp is still there
Well , I am not talking investing money , I am talking investing time , something that gives you pride afterwards but something that kinds of have a lasting impact .
but it was also bring people together . You would meet no people and ...
We have a wonderful college up on the hill , one of the best for year tradition colleges in the United States , but none of those people stay here . We invest all this time and effort for them to come to this community and then they all leave as soon as they graduate , and the reason they leave is because we do n't have the high tech industries here that this economy requires so there really needs to be an incubator or some type of a place where local industry can work with the Allegheny College students and I think we would get a lot of synergies off that .
and if I had been encouraged to explore various trade school kind of things , I might have chosen an entirely different route . I get to tinker with things all day , but ...
Well , like schools working with businesses to do mentoring and to give kids opportunities to go out into various businesses and industries and see what working in those industries is like ...
Ya I had one of my patrons just a couple weeks ago , you know that kind of thing . And , I know my soon is getting out of service in a year , he is in computers also .
And you look at Meadville and it is completely a 180 different degree , everything is growing down there , there is bustle . but the community is not all that much bigger than this community . and you can just feel it there is an energy there .
And so , we have to be able to retain our local capital , local3014 , our local people and You really ca n't recruit people to come in here , so you have to make the investment in our young people .
He might , he has been living in a warm climate for 9 years , Las Vegas and now San Antonio for his whole career and he said he wants a change of season . and he is in computer security in the Air Force.3117
And he is head of the computer security where he is at right now , so there is nothing that is going to pay him or be comparable around here .
