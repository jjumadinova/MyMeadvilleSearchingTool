**excerpts:**
Um , I love the people in Meadville .
My friends are okay , I guess haha .
We walk around and play around I guess . Ya . I do n’t know we do n’t really do anything we just walk around town .
Um , oh shoot this is a good one , my favorite memory would be like I do n’t know going around town with my friends and the um like Meadville has those littler carnival things going on in the summer . know what they are called .
I think that is Second Saturday .
Um , because it is just time spent with my friends and people around Meadville seeing what they do .
We have seen two ladies , um , wool I think it is , big things of wool and they spin it with their fingers and it goes through a big thing and they pedal it with their foot .
So , ya that ’s definitely second saturday .
The environment .
People taking care of it and it growing .
Um , because I have a lot of family and friends in Meadville .
I was born here .
Sometimes I am and sometimes I am not , because like my dad went to the high school and my family has kind of brought a bad name to our last name .
I like pizza villa because I worked there . Vocelli 's . PA sub shop , that is I like their pizza it ’s very good .
Like what we are doing here , type . I think just like in the summertime how you see like groups of kids interacting with each other and like hanging out and stuff . Kids outside of their house , not on their phones .
Um , walk around the diamond with my friends and we hang out at the parks and play basketball and play football .
Um , not really . I mean playing football and stuff like that we invite everybody so that ’s kind of meeting new people .
That ’s where me and my friends all meet up everyday and that ’s just kind of like in the middle of all of our houses and we just kind of walk around .
Because that ’s where you see a lot of kids playing and me and my friend joanna and my god daughter , we take my goddaughter there . And , she interacts with all the kids and stuff .
Just places you can go and do whatever you want and like a building where there is different areas in the building and you can do something .
Like there was a skate park inside there and an area where you could spray paint on the walls .
And , it was like in the back of an alley , in like a little abandoned area , garage thing .
Because um parents and stuff . I do n’t know my cousin and my best friend that lives in Florida we kind of made a deal that once she graduates and I graduate . I ’m going to pack everything up and move down to Florida .
You could totally do that , I mean I moved away too . You could totally do that , it ’s important . But say you did have kids here what would you want them to experience if they grew up here .
Like change all of the bad people and make them good .
Just to give you guys an incite into what people want is totally cool . I want to here like why , what kind of bad things you are talking about like I can imagine what you mean , but I want to know what you are thinking of .
Like there was a shooting by my house . Like a while ago and it would be cool if we could like prevent that from happening .
Um , create more things for young people to do um , and go places and stuff .
