elease Yes
Its a place where you can get help for mental illness . And they also give you shelter if you need it . Um , I think that 's about it .
No , just since two days before Christmas .
The help-mmm , The people , they 're nice . Um ,
CVS , Walgreens , uh , the Mall-and uh , the EAD program
I want to go there , yeah-its a good program and I wanna read better , do math better-do social studies and science better .
It 'll help me pass exams , like the SATs and the exam to get in to college . I am thinking about going for CNA to help me and to help
Um , well , I saved two people in my lifetime and I liked doing it
Well , my sister was with this guy and a car fell on top of him
They help you to learn how to live independently
The help .
Learning to live independently
uh , the confusion of walking around , giggles
Having somebody who can walk around with me
Everything being on the same block and easier to get around
um , I made some good friends here - yeah ,
um , no that 's it .
