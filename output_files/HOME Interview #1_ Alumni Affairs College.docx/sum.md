**excerpts:**
I ’m not originally from Meadville . I am from Buffalo , NY .
Um , my partner and my job . Ya , I work up at the college in development so .
I think our students like to get involved in the community and there are some good programs going on . I think it ’s pretty good , I would like to see more kind of involvement with the community from the College .
I love the summers in Meadville , there is a lot going on like the Thurston Classic was really cool we did that the other day . there ’s besides downtown Meadville , there are outlying areas that can keep you busy
Ya , there is stuff to do , you just kind of have to look for it and be creative . I do n’t know that ’s what I think .
Um , I would say probably for like a prolonged period of time . I could see myself definitely here for like the next five years , after that I am not really sure .
Um , well I think lately , like the new coffee shop and new stores coming up So , I think as long as we keep that going , and see more restaurant and shops coming in that ’s all good things happening .
