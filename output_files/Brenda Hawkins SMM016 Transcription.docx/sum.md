**excerpts:**
Head Start at Forest Green has lost its grant - we need it back .   Now its just going to be a regular day care . You know with Headstart , kids start when they 're 3 and its so important .
I would have had to take my youngest out there and my oldest out here - which worked because I work out here 6 days a week -
We thought at one time , we would like to see a Sam 's Club here , but we have   Walmart and we do n't need both .
Yeah , but a Sam 's Club is important to us , because we ca n't get to Erie much because we 're blind - and therefore we ca n't get the bulk stuff cheap and that sucks .
Some of the services in this county are the best as far as handicapped people go-um the Keystone Blind Association in this county is one of the best anywhere as far as I 'm concerned .
The Blind Association up here will take us shopping , to the doctor , to the drug store , and they will take my kids to the doctor , because after all , we were the one 's responsible for getting those kids to the doctor . So that 's what I 'm saying , the blind association here is awesome . And we 've been clients of the blind association for 30 years , I became a client when our oldest son Greg was - while I was pregnant with him
Yeah-well one of the things is - one time my son took us out to Walmart so we said we 'd get the bus home , which as soon as they seen us standing there with the wheel chair , they put the ramp down so that I could push him up , but they would n't assist me with it
well then we get to Forest Green and its too close to the edge of the grass or whatever , and the ramp stuck and chair stuck So they , the drivers , need to - they need to have the drivers assist with people in wheel chairs .
Greg had a stroke 9 years ago and now uses the wheelchair , before that he was just blind and he had a guide dog because of the wheelchair , it really became an issue - so that 's something that I 'd like to see changed with CATA - that they assist with getting them on and off the bus .

Yeah its a steep hill and no sidewalk . and I told CATA , when my husband or I get hit by a bus , there will be a law suit - it needs to come in , at least to the daycare if not all the way up , you know where there is a sidewalk and there is a place for us to sit and a way that I can put him on the bus .
Well , the bus-and stuff - again when we moved to Greensburgh , there was a bus that came once a day , but it did n't give us enough time to get anything done or really go anywhere - so we were stuck at home
Now holidays are the same way - but everybody deserves a holiday . But its better for us - there are other blind clients that do n't have no-one .
Um , the rec complex is good , but its - I mean if you 're on limited income - I mean its a good place to go , but its so expensive .
ight - and you ca n't bring your own food or drinks in there , so you 've got to pay for that there too
ight so you ca n't go take a picnic and go to the ec .
And again the Y is expensive - anywhere with a pool is expensive
so-um anyways , but we used to take Greg to it It was n't too expensive since you only had to pay for the kid .
emember what happened to caddie that time ?
emember when I went to that Kindergarten readiness program with Amadea - when they were talking about a truck that 's a mobile playground
ight , the unutilized space
Yeah there are trails , and you know we used to take Greg fishing down at the crick , right down there .
ight on the corner of Lincoln ave and ace Street , yeah right before the bridge .
