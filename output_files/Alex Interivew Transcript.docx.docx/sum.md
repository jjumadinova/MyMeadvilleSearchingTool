So like name and everything ? So , Alex Giles . 24 Caucasian male . That 's a pretty good physical description . Umm , charismatic I never used to think of myself that way but I guess I turned into a pretty charismatic guy .
In Meadville or in general ? or both ?
" wow now i 'm like managing this place and have full control over this place and do it how i wanna Here specially because I went to high school here
Just one but it was a franchise . It was in southern NH and it was called Myriad Games . I stopped working there about January 2014 , that 's when he closed the doors on all his stores and let everyone go .
I guess we got our EIN in Feb of 2016 so it 's kinda like it became a trademark business name then but was n't until the 7th of November in 2016 that the doors actually opened and we found a place .
But once it was in full swing , there were like couple nights where people were having to switch out with other people just to sit down and play games and some people
14 may have been the youngest and that was Glen and now he 's like 15 . I guess Justin and Matt 's age which is like around 40 . so it really brings a real age range in there .
So video games have this entrusting market around them where GameStop and Walmart and
like when the family got a modern computer and AOL was still a thing and Internet Explorer was the number one browser . I was doing stuff like that , playing Counter Strike , playing very free games , played World of Warcraft for a long time and it just kind of translated through growing up , was a single kid for the most part or like an only child .
Sure , of course .
it 's really really easy to let emotions get the better of you for the most part . So like take the worst gaming community like League of Legends or DOTA or something like that , like the worst , just garbage like toxic communities , I 've never seen anything near something like that for board games .
So instead of living in the apartment building we were in New Hampshire and going to school there . So a year and half combined like 5.5 year .

One of those people who are like , " man why is this good thing happening to me ? That kinda thing . This is n't gon na be forever , this is n't gon na be for more than a couple months " and
Thank you !
I guess with this pessimistic outlook and really hoping that things go so well for me really pushes me to do more and try more and to try and further the business to any means possible .
and they 're just surrounded by all these other people , it 's where people   go who in are n't just happy to see me or the store but the other people inside the store too .
but-like minis players might not like MAGIC the gathering players they are segmented by day because that makes the most out of the space and keeps people happy .
Because only so many kids can make the football team or play basketball . Go to the park , there were community based things all the time but at the same time I was a younger age . In Meadville it does seem like there are community based events for ages 6 - 12 like days at the MAC where you can go and swim or like the ice rink opens up and has a kids day but again for these high school kids

I guess with this pessimistic outlook and really hoping that things go so well for me really pushes me to do more and try more and to try and further the business to any means possible .
and they 're just surrounded by all these other people , it 's where people   go who in are n't just happy to see me or the store but the other people inside the store too .
but-like minis players might not like MAGIC the gathering players they are segmented by day because that makes the most out of the space and keeps people happy .
Because only so many kids can make the football team or play basketball . Go to the park , there were community based things all the time but at the same time I was a younger age . In Meadville it does seem like there are community based events for ages 6 - 12 like days at the MAC where you can go and swim or like the ice rink opens up and has a kids day but again for these high school kids
There were a lot of questions and a whole lot of the " board games ? I do n't understand why you gon na sell board games ? why would anyone wanna sit around and play board games ?
just cut out the need for another employee and kinda lowered my ideal space , that kinda thing . so i was looking for loans and as much money as i could for a 24 year old kid that really wanted to start his own business .
I have a couple volunteers that help out if i ever get sick or leave early for something , they 're wonderful and they come in the store
Oh yeah , for sure . As you go up in age there 's usually more beards that come in here .
say immaturity because that 's not a fair term and we have two of the most mature level headed high schoolers i have ever met in my life , but there have been groups of high school age kids that will come in here and buy like cards against humanity
I 'd say noticeable college students , not just college aged but actual students that are participating in university or higher education are very infrequent . I think the last memorable one before you was an Allegheny student who was graduating 2 - 3 weeks ago And the ones that Professor Wiebel or his wife Vesta have sent here or have pointed out have been maybe a dozen in the past six months , the actual memorable faces .
But yeah , i guess people are on phones and tablets pretty often . So as far as media goes i guess Facebook would be the big one for us .
I moved into a new apartment and I really wanted it . ( Both laugh )
During boardgame nights and stuff we would do Wil Wheatons Table Topped which was a YouTube series about boardgames , and I would put that on during those nights .
So that s a buddy of mine from a long time ago , his name is Mathew M. and he s a really awesome awesome dude . He works for Hagen industries which is a company that specializes in networking and i guess software development for larger companies .
It seems localized for the most part . and that is a very big part of the community . So the MAGIC community is very much media-centric .
, i m gon na take out my phone and browse through Facebook " because that 's what i see other people doing . SO there 's a lot of technology that 's always there .
and it were to catch on fire for some unknown reason . I 've always been very ... like .. used to using Google tools and it was really important The last business I was at , our point of sale system was through a website called Merchant OS
The MAGIC community is a wonderful community and i 've been a part of it for a really long time . So when it comes to friends and such outside of here , there are a few times , like dinners and breakfasts and stuff like that .
More space . That is the number one thing i know the customers notice when they come in . so again more space , right now we are at about 750 Square feet Still staying away from electronics like video games and systems and things like that .
Thank you ! You â€™re doing great too !
I was , i wanna So they went alittle crazy one day and kinda went off the deep end . It was kinda an open and shut case . Again media in that sense is n't very good but otherwise it 's been really great .
I suppose are the bigs ones .
just in the moment of like " oh nothing 's going on , i 'm just gon na pull out my phone " like things like that the daily posts and reblogs all that kinda thing .
Things like that happen , however i think with the right spin and the right uh , view point as to what technology does for us and social media does for us and connects people together .
Security cameras , stuff like that , videogame systems , personal computer , but no other real impressive technology .
I think i operate with a good balance kinda thing , like i do n't think i 've ever been ...
Just absolutely loved the experience of making this store and i 'd do it again !
