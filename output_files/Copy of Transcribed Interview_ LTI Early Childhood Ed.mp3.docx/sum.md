**excerpts:**
I would say the people in it , a lot of people have friends and family in Meadville , so that distinguishes Meadville from any other place you go because you always have to come back to see your friends and see your family .
I like the shops . The shops are unique and it 's like a small town shop I like that about Meadville . I am not from here so , but it is real nice .
Um , I recently moved in September from Oil City and it is not that much of a difference other than that there are more options to eat and to do everything . But , they are both small towns so they are0240 .
I am seeing even more is community members coming together and creating these big events and things for families to do and that 's a big deal .
but , I work in Meadville So I was always around town and I love that the going places project was started because that brings the community together , work with their kids , and just make it better community as a whole .
So , sort of the small size and people coming out and doing things together , the connection between families , small shops , family continuity , people coming back , sort of small town consciousness like Oil City , something very familiar that you can come back to .
I was born and raised in Erie , and I moved to the Saegertown area and worked in Meadville for the last 6 - 7 years , and one of the things that really stands out to me is the road signs that are along ...
Just those , those events .

I am from not specifically Meadville , but from Conneaut Lake . But , I was in a youth group all year round in the summer we would always go to the parks in Meadville and have a picnic , play on the swings , and stuff .
I would say if you had it in Pittsburgh or Erie , it 's like more of a city setting , whereas Meadville is more of a small town , so everyone ...
homey ... even if you do n't know people they are kind enough to at least tell you hello and it has more of a comforting feeling then if you were to go to an event at Pittsburgh and have a whole crowd and do n't know anyone .
You could go to an event two nights in a row in Pittsburgh and see not even see the same people twice . and you could see the same people and you could talk about what happened last time and what 's happening now .
Not only that but I think we are supporting each other 's businesses and things to- often . Um , some of your local businesses are running different things and it pulls in more customer base for them as well .
You know going places is here , and then through those events I started hearing about Heart and Soul , and then I started about different things going on but I noticed groups are starting to talk now and the community is starting to talk now which is huge .
I think it is starting now , it is and I know sometimes you go to systems , you said Pittsburgh and they already have things set up , but to watch   the process of how that happens is pretty exciting .
I feel like it teaches them that no matter the difference of groups , of people , because Meadville is a very diverse area .
I feel that it provides , it is providing our kids with more positive experiences in their lifetimes like being out and with their parents and it 's getting the parents to recognize that we need to do more thing with our kids .

I feel like it takes a village to raise a child so they need people with good hearts in their life , and just always keep them on track and do good , a good influence so .
And you kind of share the raising of the children , the information and the wisdom raising children and sharing with the adults and kids obviously .
and you do n't pay attention to what 's good and what 's going on . and they are going to become good people , I can go back and overrule the bad memory with all the good ones I have from where I am .



and as you are hugging your kids and you are talking to them
It 's multilevel because the kids need support with their anxieties and all the way up the ladder from adolescence to adults . But the parents need support because they transfer it down and it is a closed loop and it cycles back and forth between parent and child .
Especially , if you are a single parent it is even harder . You are a single parent

But , I think we are on the right track with the Going Places and all the different events going around town .
I know some parents have asked for particularly adolescent development groups or psychological groups , what is depression , what is cutting , or things that specifically need to be addressed .
I feel like parents do n't take as much advice as childcare as they do , because in high school I did a job thing for head start but like that 's a resource that we have
