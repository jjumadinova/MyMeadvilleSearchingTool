I I 'm going to ask you one more question . I guess so the only other question I have is what you would change , to make Meadville even better ?

The first thing you said about that bridge when I saw it was that was the exact type of attachment that Meadville has . Because it 's a bridge but it it 's beautiful and it shows your exactly what this place has to offer .
Every time we improve something it has a massive lasting effect on people .
I So what are some things you think still need to be improved on ?
and I would love to see more people want to do things like you 're doing . And like I said , the picnic thing thought that would be something that people really want .

I So what are some things you think still need to be improved on ?
and I would love to see more people want to do things like you 're doing . And like I said , the picnic thing thought that would be something that people really want .
, I want it to keep going the same way it 's going , I do n't want it to slow down . I want it to just be pushing .
I So you wanna sustain that growth . You wanna make sure that 's sustainable . Yeah , for sure .
Whether by making sure our kids are informed and intelligible about those passions and stuff or it just by having events that people continue to be involved and whatever you know . Aside from like a mass shooting or some terrible natural disaster that 'll stop it .
I Yeah .
muffled enforcement things like that . ight but it 's not those things that like for hundreds of years it was additional negative . And when we need positive and good it 's transcendent .
I Is there anything else ?
People should improve their vocabularies . But that 's besides the point . laughs
I You know , community learning , that 's always important . I appreciate you sharing all this .
Oh , of course .
