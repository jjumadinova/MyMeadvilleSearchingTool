**excerpts:**
you know , i used to be , I was a shy child , but then I became a teacher and you have to be assertive , so .... now I 'm crazy
I taught in southwestern , pa and then when we moved here I taught in ....
40 miles north of pittsburgh
You do n't know what part ?
Oh ! You 're kidding . My parents best friends lived in Dormont .
Well she just died .
She 's been dead for a while .
No . Well there is   but not in this life .
I grew up in a little town of 1500 peple , and it is okay these words are hard for me to remember even at my old age ... density means lots of people , right ?
Yes , well that 's the kind of place i grew up in . So evertyhings within a half an hour or ten minutes . and I 'd have to drive a long ways for ... I mean , H&H is there , but ...
The Saegertown Hardware 's great . So . That is ... but hten , umm ... things that somebody is involved with ... and I ca n't remember ... 'cause like Lee and a bunch of the ... and yourself .... everybody seems to kinda be ....
... together . yeah . And we have a block party at our center tomorrow that all these different configurations
Fairview Fairmont ? up on the hill ....
Anyway , um , so they 're trying to revive the City parks programs that used to be in all the parks and that was something I liked when my children ... I have a 24 and a 20 year old .
What i do n't like is to get anything continuously cultural nature although that 's improving too , slowly . You have to go an hour or 45 minutes away .
I have n't gone there yet , but boy , it looks it looks uh like top class ? high class ? So there are some good things about . I think a lot of good things are happenign now that have n't been going on .
To me ? Opportunities for people that are younger than me .
Umm like the community gardens and programs like all the things that are happening new now . Because Meadville is gon na continue to be drained of young people if young people do n't continue to be part of it .
So unless we keep adding things that are gon na attract people , then um , things are n't gon na get any better .
and when all the tool and dies closed , it was kinda like it 's helpfess because you know ... it takes a while . It takes about 20 years . ( wind )
they had an ice rink in Shafer auditorium many years ago for Beauty and the Beast and people who have lived here who have retired from the hostpital said they never have anything cultural like that in Meadville ever in all their years .
And that was the kind of thing I grew up doing . My Parents would take me to pittsburgh for different things . So . um .
NO . Because I 'm really busy . I work every day of the week .
I work at Fairview Fairmont Outreach Center . I 'm the assistant director there but I also work as a private contractor ....
Oh well we have programming for any resident that lives there from birth through time they go .... this is recorded so I ca n't say that too loud ... social services pretty much .
DUring the school year , we have uhhh homework help and tutor time for schoolage children . We 're having the block party tomorrow . We had a carnival celebrating the end of the school year just recently and ....
and this was midway point because my husband at the time was working at a job in Bradford worked there one day . Had also been offered a second job in Mercer , so he was going 12 months a year
Well not actually he and I have changed jobs . He 's still in the same system ,   but I"m not doing what I was been . But yeah , once you buy a house and all that kind of stuff you get established .
I have thought over the years of leaving .
; Our families are in southwestern PA . We do n't have anybody up here . at all .
Not a single person . And it 's a hundred miles to go see anybody in our family or you know 45 minutes if we go see my brother . He 's in Ohio and ....
Well , yeah , with working you kinda ca n't uhmmm and frankly I 'm getting old and I ca n't make that 2 hours down and 2 hours back and I ca n't make it any more haha .
Well , I do n't want them to give up their lives , quite frankly , I have another career exploration I have to fill before I croak .
I 've always wanted to be , I have a degree in music education and a masters beyond that but uhmm when I start teaching in this area , I had enough special needs students that I wanted to do music therapy
Events and people volunteering for them and their interest level
Oh just like the Thurston Classic which just happen recently .
I participated recently in the first time it 's that First Friday event where they had Josh somebody or other I ca n't think of his last name but and I had just gotten our haircut I do n't know if you read about it different sites .
We need to continue to provide for the less fortunate .
We need to not give , not do handouts but uhmmm and they 've got to be interested to . We 've ran into that issue uhmm help them find the services they need so that they also are successful .
Oh yea , women 's services there 's a lot of them .
Well my two are already grown so they had a good school system uhmmm they got to participate in sports in this area they also got to participate in music uhhhh cultural events . It 's a good place .
High school . Now I went to a high school that is similar in size 200 people in my graduating class . We knew everybody and that did n't bother us a bit . State , Ohio State that they could feel a little more anonymous .
I think that I 've done my job and they need to decide on their own .
I exposed them to all different things so it 's hard to tell .
Everybody says there used to be a whole lot more stores that you could choose from . I came there was the whole mall complex where Vernon Place is now and ...
Enough they can afford .
If we did n't have the CATA bus at all ? Seriously because some of these people ca n't walk or they the good thing about Meadville is
Yeah yeah go your mother sends you down for a loaf of bread or ...
Yeah and you ca n't do that here . Now I did when I first moved here . I do , I was living on Walnut and I would walk all the way to Valesky 's and back but that was me in fitness ... That 's just ...
For everybody to have the opportunities . Everybody has equal opportunities . Access to whatever they need to live a acceptable .
Food , clothing , decent housing .
I think we do we have a homeless shelter for men , we have women 's services
you know for women and children uhm we have section 8 housing and low income housing but I think we have waiting lists too for those things .
if somebody is trying to raise a family on like $ 9.50 and hour and most jobs are part time now so they do n't have to pay benefits .
And it 's a matter of choices too . and I 've said to my colleague yesterday you know " we need to say something like this to the adults too " they need to make good choices .
Getting married to your you know or not getting married and having three sets of kids to three different you know you know but they had the choice . Why would you do it a second or third time ?
Yes of course .
