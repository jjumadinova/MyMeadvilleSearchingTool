um the Small town atmosphere - um easy to get around - I do n't know
yeah ( laughing ) - ok the big town atmosphere compared to where I live , but it 's more small town than big-comparatively
Yeah , like you can go in anywhere and most times I 'm gon na run into someone I know
Oh , jeez since I was 18 , so like 35 years
It 's close to where I live - It 's um - would I rather work in Cochranton if the agency was there , yeah , but its still close its only a 13 mile drive and its easy to get to and fro - so
and um yeah and social wise , you know my dart night with my friends and my bowling night with my friends
um , it was very social - and after working it provided a good way to release and vent ( laughing ) - and there was alcohol involved
There was no jobs in Cochranton ( laughing ) , so I mean my first job was at the Meadville mall , I worked at the card shop there and then that led to the AC , which led to here ( Supports , inc )
but like there 's not a whole lot around for them to access - like maybe ceramic classes or photography classes or it 's usually happening on nights or weekends , which does n't really accommodate a lot of our individuals
The people that we support out in the community - we have staff that work with individuals with disabilities who live in like family living or a group home .
When I think about Meadville , I think about the hockey team - and its the school - and how great they do - and excitement when the bus comes in and the parade - I guess town spirit when it comes to the High School anyhow-and the Halloween parade
Um , because it just reminds me of my school days - I mean you always want to be an adult in high school
And I think it brings the community together when they do really well at states and they come back and everybody is out there cheering , and it shows a great community . you know .
There are some restaurants that I like , like Compadres , and Applebees I really love and Cracker Barrell too .   So I guess I would miss food ( laughing ) and places to go do things .
yeah ( laughing )
I think uh , the community involvement-more involvement and the small town atmosphere of getting people together , I think um , it just makes a town naturally grow and it stops a lot of the bad things from maybe getting bigger .

Well , I would get something for high school students to do outside of school on nights and weekends
