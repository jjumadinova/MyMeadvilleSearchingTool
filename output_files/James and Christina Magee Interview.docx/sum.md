Hello , my name 's James Magee .
And I 'm Christina Magee .
Uh , I 'm Emma .
Okay , do you want to start ? Where ever you 'd like
I am .
I 'm from Adamsville .
It 's out towards Greenville .
It 's closer to the Ohio border .
Still fairly local .
Well in that case , what brought you to Meadville or like why do you stay here ?
I stayed for family .
Um well , in Adamsville there 's nothing , uh I think that we had a post office and it burnt down .
Um well it is family oriented . I know that I like that it 's the trees , the rural kind of setting even in the city , um it still has kind of a rural feel to it because of all the greenery and stuff .
[ mutterings ] Oh yeah this one , in that case , um what were your experiences , whether where you were living before or here , what have been your experiences and interactions with technology growing up ? How did you get into your kind of field ...
Well , we 'll start with yours since yours is shorter than mine .
but I saw the advantages that it did give people . Uh , but it was , there was a clear advantage that the people that had this technology readily available , have had over the people who did n't
Are you done ?
Yeah , you can tell them ...
Alright , I know I grew up with technology , I mean at three years old , uh technically I got my associates in networking administration and security but uh , I just like fixing stuff for the most part .
Yeah , could you tell us a little bit more about about um , Techbox and what it 's like working there ?
Uh , I love working there , it 's , I 've learned a lot actually in the aspect of repairing cell phones and tablets . I found out it 's a lot easier than I thought it would be um ... I 've got an angry baby .
It 's alright [ chuckles ] , James Jr.
That is totally alright . And actually , I was gon na say we could take this opportunity , we can jump back to Techbox , but you were ...
Um well , technology in general is everywhere . Um so like we interact with technology everyday whether or not we 're realizing it Uh , because though technology has advanced greatly over the years , our interior has been left in the sixties .
No that 's perfect , yeah there is no exact answer .
Uh well , personally , first it was personal gain . I saw the technology as a way to improve my life and my family 's life .
Um , the way that we are trying to overcome this barrier is crowdsourcing , getting people to work together uh , obviously there are other financial options that have been presented to us , but uh , we 've declined borrowing money for any reason from anyone
I like to say it 's against his religion to borrow money .
Yeah , I do n't borrow money from people . then it just does n't get done . But uh , when you get into the banking systems , you get like that , you actually have other people who basically own
" I can afford five dollars but the sooner the better . Um , but yeah , technology is how we 're actually doing it , the internet , Facebook , social media , uh we built a website and ...
And have you seen a lot of activity on the website ? Have people had good access to it ?
Um , there have been a few people who have gotten involved , um unlike the crowdsourcing fund I 've noticed that locally we get a much larger number of investors but they are much smaller investments .
I know your one friend invested a couple days in a row .
Yeah . Yeah but he travels around the country so I do n't , he wo n't be back for a while , I do n't know .
Um , about two and a half grand . Which you know it 's not a lot but it 's more than I would have been able to raise by myself in a year .
A little less than a year .
Little less than a year , August will make it a year .
I thought it was actually more toward the end of August .
Ah , well technically the paperwork was dated for the 1st .
Alright , okay ...
Though it took us till the end of the month to get started , [ chuckle ] the paperwork was started on the 1st .
What would you say your goal with Increased Economic Opportunities is ? Whether social goals or ...
Um well , if I was going to describe that to you , Increased Economic Opportunities does a number of things . We improve the economy , the environment , and national security while reducing inequity .
But that is in short our goal .
No that 'd be great , if you 'd like to elaborate on those .
The more energy we produce domestically the less we have to by from foreign countries , Canada , Saudi Arabia , who ever else , um which provides us more economic stability in the country .
But I would see pretty much every south facing roof would have solar panels , every peak would have windmills , we would be exporting energy so we would have more money for local projects , uh anything from youth education and to elder benefits of different sorts .
and stuff and every house has solar panels for the business and just like the entire city is like , it 's just all tied in and flourishing .
I was wondering if you would mind , uh , if this is a good time to go back to the Techbox a little bit cause you were starting to just talk about the experience of fixing them saying that it 's a lot simpler than you thought
Uh , I know we have a lot of older clients , um they do , it actually surprises me how many older people actually do well with working , like doing their stuff on computers , figuring out their online banking , at least checking their email , and
Oh , you 're fine ... yeah no worries .
But no , it 's actually very rewarding , um , to help people , to teach people about how to use their technology , to fix stuff for them . Uh , I mean I went to LTI and they taught us
No it 's fine , that 's great . That 's mostly , most ones ... but um , I do n't know , is there anything in particular too , this is your chance to bring up , if there us anything particular
Um , I know that there are lot 's of programs that are underway . I 'm sure that you guys are aware of the majority of them than I am so ...
Not necessarily ,   [ chuckle ] but yeah
Well most of my information comes from Facebook , so and um the Meadville calendar .
Oh and Julie and Autumn , uh , Jason Sach .
Uh yeah , but they share their stuff on the Meadville calendar and uh , through facebook so , uh [ chuckle].
It makes me really happy to see people trying to do stuff for their community , like Dan Hunter , Lee and Autumn , like it 's amazing cause ...
There are lot 's of people who are unaware that these things are even happening , as much as people are trying to promote them and raise awareness .
Yeah , it 's really sad , there 's a lot of people that ca n't see the good in Meadville or the good that people are trying to do and they , they 're just so negative about it .

Oh that 's great , yeah
It 's a potluck picnic , everybody 's just supposed to go and hang out . We should have bocce and frisbees and I do n't know if anything else , I 'll have chicken [ chuckles ]
100 to 400 but I figure if you guys , you know everybody 's welcome
Bicentennial Park
Oh cool
Well close ...
Over by Meedock [ spelling ? ] across the street from Lincoln ecycling .
Yeah , I did n't realize , I 've actually , I 've met people who have never been there and I think it 's
Yeah , it 's like right over by French Creek , they 've actually got a little boat launch there and everything .
Yeah , cute little cabins where the restrooms are .
Yeah , we try to do most of our things , like anything public we do in a public place so anybody who wants to come can , we want to do more public meeting but it 's hard to , uh , get everybody to show up .
I feel like a lot of people forgot about the park because the bridge was closed for so long .
Mm hm , I have n't been there , someone was just mentioning it to me the other day , yeah .
But yeah , um so that 's about it . I know if you guys have any interest in helping IEO , I 'm always looking for people .
Oh cool , what kind of opportunities are there to help out ?
We gave ourselves a ten year start-up window , uh because it 's not , we looked at the math on it Uh , we 're not going to get 300 million dollars in a couple months or a couple years . [ chuckles ]
Or even just telling people about it .
, it 's that simple . Twenty years at like ninety five percent efficiency , factory warrantied , so like , and even after that it decreases they 're well past their prime and then they can be recycled . Um but yeah ,
That 's wonderful , that was actually one of my questions too , was if you 'd be alright with us contacting you at any point with other additional questions or possibly a follow up ...
as crowd sourcing effort , I have to be as open and as fluent with talking to people as I can be because uh , like I , it 's early on I mean , Bill Gates might be able to [ Emma chuckles ] but why would he ?
Well , why did he vaccinate an entire country against polio ?
Well cause he 's a nice guy . When you 're talking about investing 300 million dollars to invest into one small town to help 80 thousand people , they 're like " ehhh " .
it 's a lot farther down the line , but thinking long term could you see um , your business and project efforts here as being a possible model for other , either small communities or ... ?
Um that 's actually , especially [ The contest ] for you guys and the contest , we have to prove scalability . [ and replicability ] Uh , I mean you 're from Slippery ock , which I do n't believe is in Crawford County , is it ?
No uh ...
Butler County ? Uh well , we have n't expanded our service area as of yet With the grant competition we have an opportunity to get national and international recognition as far as like news stations and , it would be , I 'm sure it would get us a lot of funding if we were just on the BBC for five minutes . I mean we hit the Meadville Tribune and we got several hundred dollars the next day The Meadville Tribune did their article , we got people from Texas calling us because they saw it .
There 's all those people that like to interview you on Facebook too and stuff .
Yeah , we 've done Facebook interviews and things like that . We 've got a little bit of success there but I think that the online platform has a lot of trust issues because so many people have abused it .
Like that Nigerian prince that wants to send you money , you know
You know and I believe that that has made the ability to used the online crowd sourcing a little bit more difficult but it is still viable , uh , once you can prove that you mean what you said .
Like I had talked to some people who have worked at the Arc There 's also all of the local museums and random things that I have n't talked to anybody from Um people use the technology of some sort Uh and people , most people are like
I do n't know if there are any other questions but I think that was a great place to , that was a wonderful wrap up actually .
I think we actually covered absolutely everything I could think of at the moment . like I said if you are willing to have me or Joe contact you through Facebook or something with follow up questions
Oh yeah , [ No problem ] I 'm happy to share .
No , this was really wonderful , thank you so much .
