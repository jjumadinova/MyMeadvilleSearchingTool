**excerpts:**
The community .
and I lived in Providence , hode Island for 18 years and Albany , New York for 7 years
A little bit of both . the other thing is that both places I was working on college campuses I worked for technical institute and then Brown University . And those are transient neighborhoods so it could be partially that that there was n't that sense of community .
Well thank you , I 'm glad to be back . It 's been 11 years and I do n't regret it .
What matters most ? Affordability
Some things are cheaper some things are more expensive . Over all it 's cheaper here .
But then you know then also after I graduated from Penn State I came back and I worked as a newspaper reporter for 5 years with the Meadville Tribune And then after I moved back from New England I worked at Allegheny for uhhh 3 years
Yes I did . I really enjoyed writing the newspaper . Its just , there was no money in it . I could hardly support myself .
She got me into a summer creative writing program that was being run by two Allegheny students who were working on their masters in teachers , Allegheny still offered their masters in teaching at that point .
ah ha
Uh what brought me back was family . Yeah .
I never married and I never had children . And I have my sister sarah and her daughter and I 've spent a lot of time with those , her grand children , my sister 's grand children .
and I was able to find a job doing something I wanted to do .
P Well at Allegheny . But what keeps me what would make it better now ? I mean I like it I do n't feel like anything is missing .
Uhh Crawford County fair the county fair the uhh balloon festival , programs like this ( Grow Meadville ) , uhhmm second saturday you know and there 's a lot of irony that a lot of these programs came out of community service projects from Allegheny .
Probably the balloon festival .
Well plus it does n't cost anybody anything and you know it 's easy to get to it 's free it 's you do n't even have to go you can just look up .
Families out there the mother packed the picnic lunch or the father brought something for dinner and
We grew up within a couple blocks of the Allegheny College field and in the winter we would walk over . I was maybe 10 years old , which was really early back then .
Mmhmm and my cousins
My family and friends ... obviously . But what thing about Meadville .... Well I think the College is a tremendous asset . Umm most people do n't realize it but Meadville 's never thought of itself as a college town , not like State College or even Edinboro ...
but there 's always been a very strong hold of family-owned businesses like Channellock , Ainsworth , Greenleaf But ummm ... and they 've made a lot of very valiant efforts to become more a part of the comunity ` and that kind of thing
Yeah . I do n't know that they need to be equal but I think that they need to be aware that they 're codependent .
and I told him that I thought it was important for the College president to remember that Meadville does not consider itself a college town . It considers itself that hosts a college .
When I was in high school , we had student teachers that were from the Allegheny Masters in Arts program and that whole thing when PPMMMFFF .
There 's days I wake up and watch the Today Show and think about what stupid thing Donald Trump did or what idiot North Korea 's doing or how China is like growing so fast it does n't seem to be able to control itself . and I think you know what , I have to go over to Giant Eagle today and I 've got an interview at the MAC
Mmmhmmm it was even harder working in a dormatory and all the kids getting up to go to class and realizing you know that their father or their mother or their boyfriend or their girlfriend or old roommate had been in the towers at the time . That was ...
And to see all those kids wondering what their future was gon na be all about .
But my sister 's grandchildren are the ones that I was talking about and I like the fact that they go to a small school , that I know their teachers , that their father coaches their hockey team . That everybody is ....
Oh yeah . And I ... I do n't want you to use the term " help out " because I feel privilelged to be included . It 's not like
I know what you mean . Yeah , I know what you mean . Yeah .
Yeah . Do you know what it 's like when they fight over who gets to sleep with you that night ? You know ( laughter )
( Laughing ) It 's like , oh okay you can fight over me ! ( laugh )
we 're in fourth and fifth generations of welfare famillies that have been in child welfare services , family court ... for a town that 's so small , we have unbelievable poverty , child abuse , illnesses ...
Well obviously politics but then also serving on community boards and being active

You know I try to do stuff like little stuff on a day to day basis .
Yeah and I ’ve been doing that . But one of the things I need all the time are those plastic grocery bags because that 's what we put the stuff in they rarely come back
ight but most people if you ask them “ would you save your garbage bags for me ? ” oh sure I never know what to do with those things . And that 's something that i 've had the kids help me do .
So that they know what i 'm ’ doing and the little things they can do to support it . but you can help me collect garbage bags .
Very hard . sometimes people forget that
, you know what i mean its like lets quit putting bandaids on the problems and let 's work together to find out what 's causing the problems and what preventative measures could we put into place to keep them from developing further .
You know um you can go to kentucky fried chicken and you can buy a whole chicken meal for like 10 dollars . Well you can go to Tops and you can buy a rotisserie chicken or a whole chicken to cook in the oven for less than half that
What one thing ?
And teach them how to use that food , to make something healthy to give them the sense that they have something at stake here so that they would be willing to maybe cut open a fruit salad than open a thing of potato chips .
Well he loves wasabi . So i found that if i take fresh peas put them in the food processor , put in a little lemon juice , a little wasabi , he ’ll eat that up like , and he does n't think of it as healthy food
Yeah i got my niece one time to make an owl with me out of strawberries , pineapples , grapes .
And i 'm sure you 've become much more aware of what nutrients plants need , what nutrients plant provide you , you become much more of a chain ,   than just this random … yeah
Yeah , right and plus you have the feeling like you did something good for yourself . Yeah yeah
Change the flavor , change the texture .
Plus in terms of pride , this is yours .

Mhmm and that would be a lot more effective if i knew i 'm gon na donate 35 dollars and renee smith and her children from conneautville are gon na garden that plot for me
I would try to get teens and make it a project and get a sense of belonging and competition , like at gardens clubs and local gyms .
If you put someone in a dump , they do n't care , and it will become their dump within a matter of hours . So that it 's a matter of trying to encourage people to realize .
I would start by taking him to miller 's food factory or whatever and having him look at different plants . He actually is getting more into different plants but i 've done it from the approach of “
This is a kid that when he goes out to dinner he has ahi tuna and chicken fingers . it 's just a matter of cmon lets go and do this and i want you to do this .
His sister got really into cooking and that 's how she , and my sister used to say to her um go out in the garden and cut some basil and bring it in What was in her food
No because i do n't know how to do that , but with his grandmother yeah .
Well he 's here almost everyday anyway . I ’ll ask him about it . If he knows , and of course the best way is to get your buddy … your buddy gets interested in something , you ’re interested in it .
Would you be here without her ?
Oh well that s not a good example
