One thing ? Laughs . My name is   Kedzierski laughs , umm , oh gosh , umm one thing is tough , and I …
interrupting
I know , and I , um , and I also feel like I have different experiences because of having grown up here and then having been away and having come back .
and I think about my childhood differently than I think about things now . Um , I think , for an event in meadville that I think of is the parade , I would always consider the parade as the one event that brings out everybody in Meadville .
the people , the different groups or certain groups , certain different groups that are the same every time , and um , how ’ll they ’ll be some changes each year but it 's ... you ...


but I um , did my undergrad in Erie at Penn State . but when I went to grad school I went to Virginia Commonwealth University in ichmond , and clears throat stayed there after I got my degree and started a family down there , um , but my husbands from Erie so we have been , probably even before we had our kids were looking to come back to the area , me not ever thinking it would be meadville because I did n't think we would ever find jobs here . but then I was working for the state of Virginia doing wetland and stream permitting um , and I found that everyone , when I eventually somehow got a ernst seed catalogue everybody that was doing wetland and stream restoration were buying seeds from ernst , and one day I finally turned the catalogue over and saw their address because I did n’t know anything about them before I left and saw that it was in Meadville , and then at the time my husband had um , worked for the Virginia state seed lab , um , and was also working at the Virginia State University seed resorch , search station , and , so he had a background in seeds , and uh , so I saw this and said , I had been the one looking for a job cause I was the one with a master ’s degree I just looked up who was the , um , chair of Environmental Science at Allegheny College just to meet with him to talk about opportunities there cause I knew some cause I had interned at the DEP when I was in college .
so I kinda assumed I would work somewhere like DEP so it was Jim Palmer at Allegheny and then he said I have this thing called Creek Connections and the person who ’s running it for me is looking to go back to get her master ’s In September I started working for creek connections .
My parents were here his parents were in Erie so we were the only ones from both of our families to move far away , even though   7 hours is n't really that far laughs .
Yeah my perception looked , when I was looking after finishing up my master ’s degree was that , it was n’t gon na be worth my time to look specifically in Meadville because there were n’t gon na be a lot of job opportunities .
but she was younger than my dad and my dad struggled until his retirement to find a job and , a job that he liked and wanted to stay in , um , so
to have a career here .
certain people that know everybody and if you can get in and talk to just the right person and they would know ,
that you know it ’s networking , knowing the right people to get places and , , um , it ended up when I started talking to Jim Palmer at Allegheny College that he went to school at University of Pennsylvania with my boss in Virginia .
you know there were other things that I applied to here once we were moving here and nothing else worked out so You know like in Meadville going to events , it 's so easy to talk to people li when uh , like the community events that we have
it ’s very rare here um … um and now that I have teenagers they ’re struggling to find summer work and part time work that they want to ,
laughs Somewhere up by Jack ’s pharmacy , Ieeah , swear I did n’t do drugs so I was n’t in there laughs not making it up completely .
’s had different owners . It was called azzi ’s , It ’s had different names it was the Hat or , Top Hat or something . , I do n’t know the bar names , laughs , it just seemed like there were different things
Gas costs to much these days to make it laughs . if you wanna see people , and find out where parties were that ’s where you went , you do n’t have to do that anymore laughs
and they , lament the fact that it costs money , a lot of money sometimes , to go to the movies um , and they sometime do things like bowling or putt putt , um , but something that ’s not so money centered
Um , I do n’t know what it is , I do n’t think they know what it is either laughs .
, it ’s like you have to know people laughs it ’s like do n’t tell her that laughs . The one that ’s pet sitting is making a lot more money than the one that ’s babysitting .
People care about their dog more than their kids . Laughs Sometimes . Kids are already too expensive laughs .
laughs Well I think it 's also , well that and also , people do n’t value childcare ,
they do n’t wanna pay , they do n’t wanna pay for what the value of it is which should be really important .
mm hm , mm hm , I think so too .
um , I think one of the things that really bothers people but does n’t bother me is shopping stuff , cause I am not , a shopper . feel the need to have that stuff right here . Starbucks … Starbucks laughs
I like that we have little unique things .
You can go to Olive Garden anywhere , we live here now we can take you to the places that are local .
I mean the chain places are good for , at the 79 interchange , we do n’t need em … here .
um , I do n’t know there are certain things that would be nice if they were a little closer , but we 're , I do n’t know . um , I think um … that we definitely saw an impact of when Walmart came in and um , how it changed the stores around here ’re So yeah those kinda things drive me nuts um …
There ’s one every , every little town now has one now
yeah and they ’re running out ...
Probably laughs
And I think that ’s the new place that are running out the remaining mom and pop places , and i think that ’s horrible . it does n't make it so inaccessible to other places that have other things .
French creek laughs for sure , for sure french creek . I think Allegheny College obviously Allegheny College . like you know , we have Irish people and now it 's not and it 's um ... people are more together about that kinda stuff um ,
No I grew up at St. Agatha 's but ... no laughs but not anymore laughs . yeah my moms family was , grew up in that .

um , there 's got ta be something , people will do for this regardless . um , I think would influence people 's decisions um ... um ... lost in background noise .
I help a lot of other people be connected and um ...
whatever they call em , the planning ... plan , the strategic plan , something like that um , for the woodcock creek area the army core of engineers the whole lake area . And there 's now a bus stop out maybe at , either at woodcock or at like Ice Cream Cottage um , from from the CATA line so from Meadville .
That opens up a whole ' nother nature recreating area to people .
, I do n't know if the , if the drop of point is um , ice cream cottage area um , it 's they have now the Saegertown line so that whatever services needs ...
and I think they 've found enough , been involved in enough things found enough that they would , you know be able to walk into so many stores and know the owners and , be able to say hello , um ...
More ... more bigger places with secure jobs .
Um , but when we lost all the big um ... employer , the big steady employers all , in this short time frame um ... , i know the tool and die industry is big here
Is there you know , everywhere is struggling places that are leaving Erie now uh ... I do n't know what that is . Whether it 's the tech industry you know I do n't know um ... I do n't got the answers laughs .
And steady jobs .
that 's it 's ... , you know the other places in Crawford County . and then I and then there 's 4 days of school and then 5 days of school . and I was like
then and , I think people feel , sometimes feel a barrier about being included in our community things but , if they would , even if there not a people person like me laughs . Do I take you to bad things ?

Yeah I think it 's there own personal experience and background
