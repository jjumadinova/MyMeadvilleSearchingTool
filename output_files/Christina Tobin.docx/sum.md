**excerpts:**
I am Christina Katrina Tobin .
I like the fact that it 's a medium sized town . There 's enough stuff here where i   do n't really have to go outside of it to meet my needs .
Interesting to me ?
Well like to stay in this area ? Lives are busy , there are only so many hours in a day . so i can get everything i need without having to go more than a half hour away . Everything is right here .
Aldis is my main go to spot .
Well i was born here , my roots are here . And I m petrified to leave , that s the honest answer .
Well my family is from around here . We 're farmers . My dad is from Cambridge Springs area , i went to Maplewood . We 're just all from this general area . So we 've just always been around here .
My dad was a farmer his entire life . He bought his farm when he was 19 years old . And he farmed his entire life .
He had a dairy farm . I grew up on the largest farm in crawford county .
The Farm is still here . Unfortunately , it is not still farmed . It 's just land now , it just sits there .
When   326   foreclosed . And the Mennonites bought it   for pennies on the dollar .
Because the price of milk dropped and the price of produce dropped and it was no longer .. I was 11 so it was ' 91 when it happened .
Well industry took over , ya know big industry . And it was no longer even .. You could n't even put food on the tables .. It was no longer a profit thing . IF you just could n't even survive .
He started raising   chinchillas for pelts .
Not really . Because after that my parents split up , and it was all like single mom trying to work two jobs kind of thing .
I guess that 's what actually brought us into Meadville . My parents split up and we came into town and lived in Fairmont government housing because mom was trying to work two jobs .
Well the college definitely is a lot of what captures the spirit of this town . The first thing i do when i describe what this town is , i say its a college town .
I like the kids walking the streets and them coming and going at certain times of the year and knowing the jobs are shifting . It 's something you know is happening and it 's part of what is coming and going .
Yeah , it 's something you know is part of the town . It 's just part of being here and it 's just something that is part of the community .
Define " this " .
My kid is in tenth grade now and I 'm realizing And that 's something that I guess I really just took for granted that everybody had . and i think that 's another they took out the farming aspect .
I have no idea why .
I think what they did is they took it more towards the landscaping .
And i wanted to make sure to mention that today and how great last year i saw little spots of community gardens and the one you guys put up here last year and that was awesome that those were out .
That is cool to me because it is a community project . And I think the way to " save the world " is for the community to come together . It 's the communities , its the little things ,
It 's a physical representation of people coming together .
Not that i ve seen .
The one thing that I remember that I miss the most and that I wish was back is cruising . Such a simple thing that I wish my kid had . And like some place for the teenagers to go .
She 's 16 .
In her basement on electronics .
And that 's usually what she says . We were n't doing anything wrong , we were just driving in circles . And people knew where we were . We were easily watched . It does n't matter where teenagers are at .
I know there s been a couple dance things they 've tried to do and i can think of two in particular they 've tried in the last 5 years or so . That 's the only thing I can think of right off the top of my head .
Well we went around the Diamond , in front of the movie theater .
The one downtown ?
Yeah , the one that 's the dollar cinema now or whatever . Friday and Saturday night for like two hours or something , parked at the Diamond .
Talk . Act like teenagers .
Just chill .
Exactly . Like and it was before the time of cell phones . So if you wanted to know where someone was at , you wanted to look for somebody , they 're at the Diamond . That s where everybody 's at .
, it was everybody 's windows in their cars were rolled down . It was n't just everyone driving around with their windows rolled up , everybody just cooped up in their own little space .
i just want her to be able to get out and have fun and do things , and that 's what this town does not have . I 've got ta take her to Erie or some place else for her to get out and do things .
In this town ?
Nah this town has always been pretty dry for teenagers .
As far as entertainment goes ?
Um .. the college has offered quite a few times fun entertainment . We 've gone to a few concerts up there Um Ernst Trail has provided many evenings of great entertainment .
Um , the new movie theater coming into town was quite nice . We do n't honestly go out a lot and do a whole lot of out type entertainment . Mostly because we fall on that nice little category of .. what do you call that ?
Yeah for the most part . My daughter is quite involved in the academy theater .
See if you would n't have asked me ..
She 's been involved for the last year or so .
She auditioned for Beauty and the Beast and got really upset with the process .
They 've been going to Allegheny College and have been doing stuff there . But her and her best friend do a lot of that kind of stuff together .
Sometimes . I m usually the taxi . I need a hat .
I have a really awesome memory of when my kid was little , like 2 or 3 , Easter time at the Market House . and she had made a little apple , Squeeze made her a little apple out of a balloon . They had the Market House all decorated up for Easter , that was 14 years ago
Well it definitely says that Market House is something that we value and take care of and that we make sure to draw people in for holidays and celebrate young children and families and those types of things .
I do still go to the Market House . I was there just a   couple weeks ago as a matter of fact .
I was there for breakfast with friends then we shopped around for a little bit .
I have been above the Market House . My daughter has taken classes there for artsy things .
No new sightings , no construction of any sort . So last year when I started seeing like new sighting and new , like um , road construction and professional type construction and stuff like that and things actually happening , ya know that was a little encouraging to me
but even if she just did regular cosmetology , that 's bigger cities and things of that sort as well .
I do n't know . I really do n't know the answer to that question . I am in a process of personal transition and I do n't have a good answer .
That is definitely the spot for teenagers . and this is the spot . Some place they wanna go , some place they wanna be that they can . Ya know , there used to be a pool hall in this town . It was a cool spot .
I do n't think they 're treated like they 're people . And f we treated them like they were actual people with actual opinions , we would actually get wonderful things from them because they are amazing , wonderful creatures with amazing , wonderful minds .
I got the gardens in , I got the teenagers thing in . I think those were the two big things I wanted to make sure to touch on .
They are definitely the generation that is going to be able to do something .
