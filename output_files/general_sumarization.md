I love all the fun things you can do with friends and family and all the activities you can participate in , and I feel it 's like a strong little community . That we all work together and have fun .
What matters to me most is my friends here . Because I feel friends ( and a lot of my family is here too ) , friends and family are a very important thing in your life .
My favorite memory about living in Meadville is probably playing baseball and doing all these fun games at baseball .
Some stuff to make living here easier would be cutting taxes , creating more jobs , and making it so we 're more of a more strong economic ... economy .
Probably all the history we have , because our history dates clear back to the 1700s . And there 's just so many things you can do like the Baldwin eynolds House , and even Diamond Park is history .
Probably if everybody just left that were my friends it would make me miss Meadville . Like if all the activities were gone like bowling and putt-putt it would not be Meadville anymore .
Probably strong friendships and the fair . The fair creates lots of money for us and its a fun activity too that needs to keep on going as a tradition .
I want them to experience all the things you can do like bowling and like even some of the restaurants like Eddies and Casey 's . They need to experience that local charm .
My one wish for Meadville would be to make all the houses look nice .

I 'd say what I love most about the city of Meadville is that it has all of the attractions and items of a much larger town , but it has a very small-town , family-friendly oriented community .
I am a teacher , so what matters most to me would be not only having a great education system for my children , but also an education system that I am proud to work in . That is what matters most to me about that .
My favorite memory would probably have to be the Crawford County Fair . That is something that I look forward to the most each year from the time I was 8 years old . So I would say my strongest memory is the Crawford County Fair .
We also have two children , so having a great family atmosphere and a family-friendly town was important to us as we raised our family . Our families grew up here in this area and we 're happy to be around them , and stay in a great community .
As I said my husband is in manufacturing , so seeing a good , solid base in the economy would be something that would make us stay here .
I would say , knowing the president of the Chamber , I think she 's doing an amazing job providing events and opportunities for both small and larger businesses within the community . Also making Meadville very community centered I think she does a great job of that .
I think something that I of course would miss a lot would be the Crawford County Fair , if it was n't here .
So between a strong education system and also jobs that people can have that people can make a good honest living off of will keep people here , and keep the town thriving .
What draws us here and keeps us here is all the items of a large town but in a much smaller community oriented . I want them to be able to have all the great memories that my husband and I share .
Or it would be to continue the growth of helping by taking those buildings down and putting some new in . I would probably go with newer buildings versus all the effort and time and money that it would take to restore a lot of these historical places .

Yeah . And in the winter , I 'm off doing other things so
I get when I go down to some of the community events , especially ones at the market house . I like the small community feel , I like that there 's still a lot of really great events you can go to . And with the MCA , I like when they offer shows and stuff there .
It was Uma 's . Uma was doing an Indian cooking class . But it 's just , it was n't really advertised well . And I ran into her at light up night and then I totally forgot .
Me too . , i forgot , i need to sign up for the next one ' . But I love what the market house has to offer , cooking classes , second saturdays , and the MCA .
I really like the small community , and my boyfriend is here . That was a big reason for it . Family is really the reason for that .
I love how Voodoo has actually bought one , and is potentially going to open it up so we can see that brewing process . I love that those spaces are still there .
Oh my gosh , the Market House . That would be , I do n't even know what i would do without the Market House . I mean I could tell you a couple things I could go without , but the Market House is essential .
I 'm sure a lot of people say that . It 's like one of the key things .
Well I think that one of the things is we really need to invest in our small businesses .

Big town feel . Small town living .
It provides me with all the services that I need because its big enough population wise but small enough that I do n't have to worry about not knowing my neighbors personally .
24 hour shopping .
None of its volunteer .
Low crime .
I do n't know if I have a favorite memory .
I like going to the downtown Meadville Days in the summer whatever they 're called .
My job .
I work for Warner Kline Machine out of Erie Pennsylvania .   I transferred down here because the person running the Crawford County Office , um , got a much better job so I was able to jump up the company ladder , really fast really far simply by taking the position in Crawford County rather than staying in the city of Erie .
Again , small town feel with bigger town amenities .
That ’s what would make it easier .
I do n't want the city government looking over my shoulder on everything I do on my private property .
No not really . I would hope that being a smaller town that they would n't create laws in a politically correct vein just to satisfy their image .
What things ?
I can go anywhere in this country and say the word Channel Lock and everybody knows what I 'm talking about and that ’s all here .
What would I miss ?
Channel Lock
The manufacturing base here , the design base .
Umm , to attract more manufacturing and maybe less service oriented jobs .
Um , self-reliance , self-sufficiency .
Primary education .
I would say they provide a good , I would n't say they provide an excellent or outstanding , its good .
Um , allocating resources to students can actually benefit from it .
Those need more money .
The weather
Do you mean , I do n't know , Meadville 's Government to make it better ? Or ...
That they spend their tax revenue wisely and not on silly things .
I would much rather have Liberty Street paved .

Umm ... I guess maybe I could just ignore them all the time but some people get to me , so ...
The Market House , downtown is definitely an older building so I mean that actually does capture the whole meaning of Meadville as in the whole downtown because they are all old buildings so I mean .
The history 's great but I feel like they should start upgrading things because as time goes on people are going to be more about technology and not about the past .
I do n't believe any of children or grandchildren are going to be visiting Meadville at any time so ...
Because I would like to get out of here and experience bigger and better things in the world .
I think they should add a better youth system for all of the younger kids .

but I um , did my undergrad in Erie at Penn State . but when I went to grad school I went to Virginia Commonwealth University in ichmond , and clears throat stayed there after I got my degree and started a family down there , um , but my husbands from Erie so we have been , probably even before we had our kids were looking to come back to the area , me not ever thinking it would be meadville because I did n't think we would ever find jobs here . but then I was working for the state of Virginia doing wetland and stream permitting um , and I found that everyone , when I eventually somehow got a ernst seed catalogue everybody that was doing wetland and stream restoration were buying seeds from ernst , and one day I finally turned the catalogue over and saw their address because I did n’t know anything about them before I left and saw that it was in Meadville , and then at the time my husband had um , worked for the Virginia state seed lab , um , and was also working at the Virginia State University seed resorch , search station , and , so he had a background in seeds , and uh , so I saw this and said , I had been the one looking for a job cause I was the one with a master ’s degree I just looked up who was the , um , chair of Environmental Science at Allegheny College just to meet with him to talk about opportunities there cause I knew some cause I had interned at the DEP when I was in college .
so I kinda assumed I would work somewhere like DEP so it was Jim Palmer at Allegheny and then he said I have this thing called Creek Connections and the person who ’s running it for me is looking to go back to get her master ’s In September I started working for creek connections .
My parents were here his parents were in Erie so we were the only ones from both of our families to move far away , even though   7 hours is n't really that far laughs .
Yeah my perception looked , when I was looking after finishing up my master ’s degree was that , it was n’t gon na be worth my time to look specifically in Meadville because there were n’t gon na be a lot of job opportunities .
but she was younger than my dad and my dad struggled until his retirement to find a job and , a job that he liked and wanted to stay in , um , so
to have a career here .
certain people that know everybody and if you can get in and talk to just the right person and they would know ,
that you know it ’s networking , knowing the right people to get places and , , um , it ended up when I started talking to Jim Palmer at Allegheny College that he went to school at University of Pennsylvania with my boss in Virginia .
you know there were other things that I applied to here once we were moving here and nothing else worked out so You know like in Meadville going to events , it 's so easy to talk to people li when uh , like the community events that we have
it ’s very rare here um … um and now that I have teenagers they ’re struggling to find summer work and part time work that they want to ,
laughs Somewhere up by Jack ’s pharmacy , Ieeah , swear I did n’t do drugs so I was n’t in there laughs not making it up completely .
’s had different owners . It was called azzi ’s , It ’s had different names it was the Hat or , Top Hat or something . , I do n’t know the bar names , laughs , it just seemed like there were different things
Gas costs to much these days to make it laughs . if you wanna see people , and find out where parties were that ’s where you went , you do n’t have to do that anymore laughs
and they , lament the fact that it costs money , a lot of money sometimes , to go to the movies um , and they sometime do things like bowling or putt putt , um , but something that ’s not so money centered
Um , I do n’t know what it is , I do n’t think they know what it is either laughs .
, it ’s like you have to know people laughs it ’s like do n’t tell her that laughs . The one that ’s pet sitting is making a lot more money than the one that ’s babysitting .
People care about their dog more than their kids . Laughs Sometimes . Kids are already too expensive laughs .
laughs Well I think it 's also , well that and also , people do n’t value childcare ,
they do n’t wanna pay , they do n’t wanna pay for what the value of it is which should be really important .
mm hm , mm hm , I think so too .
um , I think one of the things that really bothers people but does n’t bother me is shopping stuff , cause I am not , a shopper . feel the need to have that stuff right here . Starbucks … Starbucks laughs
I like that we have little unique things .
You can go to Olive Garden anywhere , we live here now we can take you to the places that are local .
I mean the chain places are good for , at the 79 interchange , we do n’t need em … here .
um , I do n’t know there are certain things that would be nice if they were a little closer , but we 're , I do n’t know . um , I think um … that we definitely saw an impact of when Walmart came in and um , how it changed the stores around here ’re So yeah those kinda things drive me nuts um …
There ’s one every , every little town now has one now
yeah and they ’re running out ...
Probably laughs
And I think that ’s the new place that are running out the remaining mom and pop places , and i think that ’s horrible . it does n't make it so inaccessible to other places that have other things .
French creek laughs for sure , for sure french creek . I think Allegheny College obviously Allegheny College . like you know , we have Irish people and now it 's not and it 's um ... people are more together about that kinda stuff um ,
No I grew up at St. Agatha 's but ... no laughs but not anymore laughs . yeah my moms family was , grew up in that .

um , there 's got ta be something , people will do for this regardless . um , I think would influence people 's decisions um ... um ... lost in background noise .
I help a lot of other people be connected and um ...
whatever they call em , the planning ... plan , the strategic plan , something like that um , for the woodcock creek area the army core of engineers the whole lake area . And there 's now a bus stop out maybe at , either at woodcock or at like Ice Cream Cottage um , from from the CATA line so from Meadville .
That opens up a whole ' nother nature recreating area to people .
, I do n't know if the , if the drop of point is um , ice cream cottage area um , it 's they have now the Saegertown line so that whatever services needs ...
and I think they 've found enough , been involved in enough things found enough that they would , you know be able to walk into so many stores and know the owners and , be able to say hello , um ...
More ... more bigger places with secure jobs .
Um , but when we lost all the big um ... employer , the big steady employers all , in this short time frame um ... , i know the tool and die industry is big here
Is there you know , everywhere is struggling places that are leaving Erie now uh ... I do n't know what that is . Whether it 's the tech industry you know I do n't know um ... I do n't got the answers laughs .
And steady jobs .
that 's it 's ... , you know the other places in Crawford County . and then I and then there 's 4 days of school and then 5 days of school . and I was like
then and , I think people feel , sometimes feel a barrier about being included in our community things but , if they would , even if there not a people person like me laughs . Do I take you to bad things ?

Yeah I think it 's there own personal experience and background

Merit , I think the balloon festival , I think that 's when you think of Meadville something that you always , think about , and I know that 's something that we 've always gone to . That would probably be the one thing that comes to mind .
It 's something unique and different that you ca n't find in other areas .
Well I guess watch the balloons . laughs
We 're boring .
Um ... the small community atmosphere , I think that 's I mean we 're Cochranton there is because of the community and um , Meadville 's the big city laughs when your in Cochranton
Safe environment .
Uh , nice place to raise family .
I think for the most part . I think it 's changed over the years but now you here all the different stories of things that happen so you , are a little bit more hesitant .
Well um ... like the up at Walmart , they just had that incident where the lady was gettin ' followed around and , again just different .
Creepier things that never used to happen 25 years ago laughs . And there seems to be more violence in the community than there was 25 years ago .
I 've been in Cochranton my whole life ,
and then , I worked in Meadville ... College I worked in Meadville , Um , I 've been in Venango County the last five years but , other than that I 've basically always worked in the Meadville area .
Closeness to home . Um you ca n't find anything much more closer than laughs . Especially in Cochranton there 's not much , not many jobs .
So , I 'm in Meadville .
The same reason you know it 's close , um you know it 's a quick easy drive and the jobs are decent so , why go anywhere else I guess .
We do shopping . Again there 's not many options in Cochranton so we when you need something you end up running to Meadville . And it 's not that bad of a , you know fifteen minutes and you 're there .
so we do n't you know um , we 've got a movie theater in town now so we do n't use the theater to much in here . Uh we used to go to the rec complex , so ...
Uh more children activities and events . But it would be nice if there was more opportunities for them . Um , there 's so many opportunities for dance and gymnastics and that stuff but it all comes with a hefty fee too .
Um ... just like little I do n't know like activity days type thing , different things like that .
I think those are nice events , and the downtown mall . they did a few years ago did it , a um like multicultural event , and they had different stations set up in the downtown mall and you could go and do activities at each one
Where there 's different activities for the kids to do .
yeah it 'd be nice to have some kinda ... dance program or something that did n't cost so much you know laughs .
Mm hm .
Um , we 've done the dance , and payed and arm and a leg laughs .
Um ... the Y , does a lot of nice programs we 've done a lot of the Y programs we 've done the gymnastics and the tee ball and the soccer because they 're short term
Or is like , the sporting teams the tee ball like , through the little leagues are more , so yeah we 've done   the Y programs we 're pretty happy with those .
yeah and the emphasis on the child having a good time and enjoying it not , being pressured to always be the winner .
I do n't know if i would know that , especially I mean if you grew up here and went to school here and stuff , probably have a different ... I mean I could tell you that about Cochranton , you know .
And they 're always pretty good about donating stuff , different places I worked
Um , gosh I 've done a whole array of stuff ,
I mean just from getting Chinese auction donations for church , to um , doing like annual fun type projects so , I do n't know the whole way , the whole spectrum .
Yeah , you get tired of asking but ...
I 'm sure they get tired of being asked at the same time .
Well I think some of the bigger , like dads and channel lock like if they pulled out I think it definitely would affect the community just because of how many people they employ .
Um pause mm pause .
Yeah , yeah some channel lock people , and I think like , especially both of those are well known companies ,
That are in Meadville so that 's kinda like a signature , or branding type
You know that 's Meadville type ...
I blacked out , yeah I think those would , I think they would affect if either one of those companies pulled out .
I think that this My Meadville project and the different things that have spun from that um , are important like even with , what is it Dan Hunter , doin' those rose huts and things laughs but similar things like that that got people excited .
Probably because , they 're probably lookin ' for something free too laughs .
But , I mean it got them out in the community and it was a great move on his part for promoting his business too I mean they were all lookin ' on Facebook waiting for him .
So , I just think it was a neat , neat idea that he came up with .
Mm hm . We used to when they he was in Cochranton one time we ,
We , we went out and ... I mean it was a neat little scavenger hunt too .
I 'll have to convince him to go to Cochranton again laughs .
No not right now .

Oh boy .
I think it 'd be nice to see indiscernible I mean there was a while where the down town was just kinda , abandoned type thing .
but , I always think that would be nice if we had some sort of bigger department stores and stuff that you typically have to run to Erie for .
Yeah , for Hermitage or Butler .
Um , just cause like , places like Sam 's Club , you can only get so much at Walmart laughs .
So , and even like the department stores and that kinda stuff , again Walmart has its limits .
Or you end up going on Amazon .
Mm hm .
Well like you used to go down to chestnut street and there was so many empty places and um , park avenue ... and it just seems like some of those store and businesses   are getting revitalized and um , some of the activities that are happening like the second Saturdays at the Market House and um , do n't they do that band thing too ?
they did it on top of a , what was it a garage ...
Yeah yeah I mean they 're doing more activities to get people to come downtown and I think that 's pretty important .
It 's almost like two little mini towns for our new township and then downtown .
Um , cause so much for years was growing in Vernon township and like , your grocery , just bigger grocery stores and mean you could very feasibly have to do everything in Vernon township and never set foot in downtown .
Yeah , cause it 's not typically like I do n't , shop downtown unless I 'm looking for something specific .
Um pause . Well I guess you got Tops , I guess some of those bigger department stores . But where in the world would you put it you know laughs . So ...
No I think that 's pretty good .
Thank you , I 'm glad you were able to come in and

I love all the community events like second Saturday where you can go and have fun with your friends or family , and I like all the locally owned shops such as creative crusts and tattered corners , and I like that there is not a lot of crime here
Um my favorite memory is in the summer I would go to the farmer ’s market with my parents and then we 'd go to creative crusts and get bread and we would have tons of fun .
My dad got a job here and so we moved here and I stayed because of my parents .
Having more places to hang out with my friends and more places to shop at .
The big zipper where all the people contributed pieces to it and all the road signs out by giant eagle .
Um , creative crusts because I go there practically every weekend and its , you can just sit there and talk or you can like eat its its really nice .
Um , its important to continue community events and uh having low crime rate .
To have more shopping options like build a better mall or expand the downtown mall to have more places that teenagers would like to shop at like H&M or like forever 21 or Hollister , places like that .

I So yeah , if you um there 's a ton of different ways to get involved . So um we can talk about that too .
And then there was an absence of non market authority for it muffled . but it 's a little antiquated for this kind of thing .
I Yes . mhm but yeah I mean this is a great way to get involved . And so it 's coming out of the rebuild and so are
Overlapping talk government sanction thing or that just people organized person organized thing
I This My Meadville project ?
the- the
The redevelopment authority is a government it 's the same way the market authority is kind of under the city umbrella um but like we 're actively working to get something else on board like we 've had one of the council members join the leadership team recently like um
Now is there like something that you 're just using for your own or is it something like a poster ?
they take out the whole thing right so if you talk about certain things then they 'll say ok that fits this theme of what people are talking about . and we 're like hey but that 's up to you
, I know someone uh zoning board , I know the democratic party here , and stuff not the head of it the office where the democratic party of Meadville muffled Minute 306 I do n't want to overstate personal connections and you know what I mean is all
I Ok , no I mean so yeah
So is there a right answer or should I start with like it was a misty afternoon in May 1991 when I was born or should I try that ?
I laughs   Well we do have some uh uh muffled so uh Jack and Marv .... well you can answer them all together you could just be part of the conversation , Jack what is your last name ?
Muffled so technically my first name is John
I mean but no one calls you John
ight but I mean
I No it 's however you wanna , Marv what 's your last name ?
I Cool um so you 've been in Meadville for a long time
Yeah this is year 26
I Ok So did you always live in the city
yeah well West Mead but right up from the hospital up Leighton oad right up there
I Yeah , and do you live around there now ?
No so technically we live in an apartment right behind McDonald 's but we just purchased a house .
I eally ? Congratulations , wow .
We 'll be living on Column , right below the college
I Yeah , cool . That 's a nice neighborhood .
It 's a nice neighborhood , it 's got it 's since it used to be like an all Allegheny apartments and stuff too it 's really turning into more like younger families moving in
Yeah , because the college changed the way their living arrangements were on campus and stuff so like now you have to stay there unless you have like certain privileges your senior year , and that 's like the only time you can move off campus in the college
So now they move like families in there , it 's really awesome
Cuz there was even , there was even a house that two of my friends had lived in that was like a six seven person apartment that 's now for sale a whole house . " ok that 's not going to be seven college kids living there
I The one on Column that has like stairs that go up yeah I 've had friends that live there
I was going to say , I feel like
If you went down I spent my last two years of college at Allegheny so I graduated from
I ok what year ?
I now have to study journalism like tv production like um everything yeah and that was my last 8 credits , it was kind of a let down
I So were you Comm arts
Communications and political science uh political science was my minor but that 's but I was like I do n't want to spend that much more money plus the scholarship you get for being from Meadville you get like a $ 10,000 scholarship
I Oh really ?
Yeah for each year for two years if you 're like from the area it 's like you just through an endowment but I was like cuz they were like " you have to live on campus " and I was like " uh excuse me
I So uh mar you said you been living here for a year
A little bit over do n't you think
This summer will be two years so
I So where were you before
Clarion at Clarion College
I Did you guys meet at Clarion
Attended at Clarion laughs
I Yeah but when you were in the Clarion area , that when you
Well he came he was going , he 'd already gradated , and we met and um I was still living in Clarion and he came up there for muffled
I That 's funny because this project used to be called Heart and soul anyways laughs that 's cool so uh you 've been here for you 've been living in town for a year and a half
Yeah we lived on park ave at first and then that February , we moved down to the apartment we 're in now we 've been there since
I And so you were from Clarion
I am not
Yeah her situations a little more
I was born in Clearfield I have lived in muffled ridgeway and uh waynesboro and Pittsburgh
I ok
And you lived in Connecticut or Deleware
I Yeah so now you 're
Went to Erie college um and I lived there throughout college and then even like my senior year I took classes muffled
that 's really big and stuff we 're hoping to get an opportunity to go back somewhere and finish her degree or do something else they have a program too at college for women overlapping talk
Yeah that would be really awesome
Cuz like I do n't know how
I Yeah
the thing works with the Meadville scholarship I do n't know if you have a certain amount of time to get there or what
probably I 'm not sure , I think you have to be a resident
This would be a big deal especially with where we live she could walk everyday to the college
I Yeah Column 's right there I know a psych professor that lives on Column street . who has a young kid
My favorite professor I ever had lives on Column too , uh professor Christy-Searles
I oh yeah yeah
Yeah he was awesome
I Well he uh did you hear what his plans are ?
I mean this guy has done everything and like can do anything and that 's why it 's so remarkable and he had like a degree from MIT , he had a degree , he 's working on his doctorate he might have completed by now
I Yeah so he is leaving Allegheny and he 's gon na go to be a Buddhist monk
That does n't surprise me he 's done research with   overlapping he has done something
I It 's crazy just like ok bye
One of his research projects is like community of monks somewhere it might have been south america I think it was I mean he like lived with them for six months that 's literally something I 've always thought of
We had a group of tibetan monks at clarion for
I Yeah they did one at Allegheny too
I That 's really cool
It was only like one credit but I just wanted to take
They actually take the sand and they have a ceremony where they like pour it into a river
Yeah so like what they do they destroy the whole thing after they made it and then they take it to a river and it does n't matter how much effort you put into something it still
I Yeah like permanence and yeah and detachment
I guess that there was some um monks that came up to allegheny they ` were up here for about a week but they did the same thing they like i saw people later and they were like look and they like and they had little vials of the sand
Did they give them or did they take them
I I think they were like giving them and I was like that 's cool but like does n't that defeat the point is n't it supposed to like you 're not supposed to keep it cuz like you 're yeah it 's supposed to but anyways
I um
That 's like a funeral with all the incense I mean we have celebrations of death just like we celebration of life
I So I 'm wondering what do you love about Meadville
I But it 's what that was what you felt from your perspective , that how you viewed it
I That 's great that 's really cool . What about you , what do you love about Meadville ?
I mean it 's not far , but like everyone was graduating now people were moving and I 'm here like I wanted to move here and wanted to move in with him and then there 's the whole thing in Meadville I 'm
I Yeah for sure
I He 's great , let me tell you
Well I thought that was kind of cool also understood I was like I know way more people than I thought I did like
I So I think I know what brought you to meadville , why do you stay here ?
I Would you agree Jack
But Voodoo has some bands that overlapping
I cool
I He 's the manager of northwest state , it 's over by the Marc
I No that 's valuable
I And that 's created by like one person , spearheaded by one person with help with a couple others that like want to do this he just started it .
I Jason Zackle , started the website
He 's been doing a lot of stuff you mentioned your son growing up in a place where there 's always something to do and he can have something to do .
In other words we ran into people we knew there was other people we did n't necessarily know " oh we 're getting through to the same person , you know drinking the same thing .
Oh I wanna get out of here and I 'm like coming from someone whose lived here less than two years . it 's muffled so the parks shut down and they were all just going to get together and set up a table

**excerpts:**
Well I think that the transit system is excellent . Now that I 'm a senior I have a free bus pass to the city bus and share a ride , for two dollars one way in Meadville and I have n't driven a car in eleven years .
And also , I really appreciate Chaps and Journey Center because they have made a quantum leap in my recovery of my mental illness . Before I came here my mental illness was very personal and after i came here
they said that 's really unusual to have such a good system you say you live in a rural area , and I 've been told by my mental health services that Meadville has the best services of um , a lot of places .
I lived in quality living center for a year and a half and when I needed their services they were excellent , very supportive they provided transportation so that I could come into town and take this dialectical behavior therapy classes , which lasted several months .
And I appreciate that sharing of communications and socialization .
Well my two of my classmates from second grade on live in Meadville , and we still get together ,
We 've been best friends over 60 years
At least once a week .
Mostly my mental health services .
My therapist .
Gave me an application for Park-Side Commons which he felt like I 'd be independent from quality living center . pause
Mm ... Second Saturday .
Well that 's a bunch of vendors at the Market House , but they also have entertainment and projects for children on the second Saturday . On the other Saturdays its vendors for produce . But on Second Saturday it 's more comprehensive to the community .
Yeah I think it 's like from eight to two and then they have Meadville Friday , which is for Friday evenings .
I do n't know I do n't go ...
I think there 's food and ...
pause Journey Center .
Because they 're a certified club house , indiscernible club house , which means we have an international networking ... and so we get impressions , and strengths and weakness from all over the United States . but I know that it 's an international organization .
In fact a similar reason I 'm not living in Southern California now .
Yeah it is .
I would say Second Saturdays and the , I ca n't remember the title of that program when they were having that series of presentations last summer but I think just , the college students , and their advocacies as a community .
Women 's services
Mental health in Meadville , um , there was one about um , violence .. about when you should call somebody , I ca n't remember the title of that presentation . pause
No it 's been a good year .
they are very purposeful and uh , and they um , have a lot of out reaches like taxes and the library does taxes too , and I 'm only about two blocks from the library
Yeah . pause
But if you , I 've lived in , I graduated nursing school in New York State , moved to Southern California ' 69 to ' 88 , worked in Ohio , New York , California , and Pennsylvania nursing
ight because they 've lived here all of their lives . pause
pause Well that they have ... through their presentations and seminars and services they provide they have uh , um , very extensive outreach to the community .
Uh yeah all the , all the college students and ... active aging , and Journey Center , Chaps . pause
Sure , nice meeting you .
Now what board are you on I 'm on the advisory board .
If it 's got ta be big it might as well be cheese .

I ’m not originally from Meadville . I am from Buffalo , NY .

I think our students like to get involved in the community and there are some good programs going on . I think it ’s pretty good , I would like to see more kind of involvement with the community from the College .
I love the summers in Meadville , there is a lot going on like the Thurston Classic was really cool we did that the other day . there ’s besides downtown Meadville , there are outlying areas that can keep you busy
Ya , there is stuff to do , you just kind of have to look for it and be creative . I do n’t know that ’s what I think .
Um , I would say probably for like a prolonged period of time . I could see myself definitely here for like the next five years , after that I am not really sure .
Um , well I think lately , like the new coffee shop and new stores coming up So , I think as long as we keep that going , and see more restaurant and shops coming in that ’s all good things happening .

In crawford county , not Meadville .
Specifically Meadville ?
I guess there was a lot more downtown stores . We had sidewalk sales , you know I remember that from my childhood . Coming to sidewalk sales , and walking up and down chestnut street . But , I do n’t know .
Well ,   one of my customers moved to Alaska and then when he visits Meadville he buys flowers .
There are a lot of good customers .
Oh ya , I think a lot of people come to the Market House to socialize , go eat , and visit . It is a destination where people meet . They ’ll say let ’s meet at the Market House .
No , I it is one of those things where I am still learning . There is always questions , somebody always has a question . and he knew if somebody had a question he would refer to it . But , he sold hers and other things too .

# My Meadville Transcribing.docx
**sum:**
**excerpts:**
I love all the community events like second Saturday where you can go and have fun with your friends or family , and I like all the locally owned shops such as creative crusts and tattered corners , and I like that there is not a lot of crime here
Um my favorite memory is in the summer I would go to the farmer ’s market with my parents and then we 'd go to creative crusts and get bread and we would have tons of fun .
My dad got a job here and so we moved here and I stayed because of my parents .
Having more places to hang out with my friends and more places to shop at .
The big zipper where all the people contributed pieces to it and all the road signs out by giant eagle .
Um , creative crusts because I go there practically every weekend and its , you can just sit there and talk or you can like eat its its really nice .
Um , its important to continue community events and uh having low crime rate .
To have more shopping options like build a better mall or expand the downtown mall to have more places that teenagers would like to shop at like H&M or like forever 21 or Hollister , places like that .
1 homer
2 ?
3 ?
1 Was it hard to find the place ?

1 Um keystone .
1 You was talkin to me ?

1 Naw not really , I ca n’t say I really do . 'Cause I ’m that I ’m the type of person I get along with anybody so . Um . Naw I do n’t have no story about that .
1 Just growing up here was fun . Just Meadvilles a nice little old town .
1 Yea we we found stuff to do you know , go up to Allegheny college , play up there and play basketball up there and stuff on their courts . Now its like you ca n’t really do it , you know . They do n’t
1 You know like kids now gettin out like we used to . There used to be baseball fields you used to be able to go to play baseball all day . Stuff like that .
1 Ah ha yea that ’s right up the street .
1 Yea .
1 Oh yea I guess it would be an opportunity I just ai n’t been up there in so long . You know they got swimming in the rec and the ice skatin rink and the roller I think they got roller skating in the summertime .
1 Oh they do n’t . Oh ok see its how long its been .
1 Oh do they ?
1 Yea a skateboard park .
1 Yea . It used to be one over that hill , where rat lake is . They call it rat lake .
1 Yea we from Meadville too ?
1 Oh ok
1 Yea you get a lot of opportunities if you know the right people . There ’s a lot opportunities around here .
1 As far s going to school . Ya know get a nice education . They got a good school system . Um ( pause )
Just , for me it be my friends , 'cause I got a lot of friends . And since I ’ve been in this situation I ai n’t been around I ai
2 I ’ve lived here all my life , that ’s why it feels like home
1 I told them Meadvilles a lot of friendly people around here .
2 Its just a nice quiet calm town , I , this is the best pace to raise your children . It really is !
2 There is n’t much that ’s one thing that Meadville needs to do is they need to get something for our teens our pre - teen adults .
1 Keep them off the streets
2 There ’s nothing for them to do to keep them off the streets . I remember when I was younger , they had up y-teens , they had um , arcade places , they had um …
1 The parks used to be open in the summertime
They used to have summer parks , children go to the summer park do crafts , games , they do n’t have the no , College kids used to even go to the parks , and up they did a lot of crafts and stuff with the kids .
1 Elm   street .
2 Elm street .
1 Yea
2 And that ’s more like um they do school supplies stuff for the children , the needy children , and then they do a little carnival along with it . I think that ’s the only exciting thing Meadville has for out children .
2 What are those skates called ? Uh ..
2 No , the big long wood things ...
2 Skate , they have skating board up there . But , you got ta have this to be able to get in and enjoy that . You know , I I think Meadville needs to concentrate more on our children .
1 How long have I been blind , about four years ?
2 About five years .
1 Five years
2 Yea
1 Tell 'em you know I used to go to the basketball court the college and you know play basketball , baseball , used to have baseball fields , softball .
They wonder why the crime rate is getting high in Meadville , and it is , I mean I can remember when I was 15 years old I mean we were a close community , and now its like , there ’s ...
1 I told them it was like Mayberry
2 Yea mmhmm yea almost like Mayberry , but now you 've got a lot of people moving into Meadville um . and so therefore they 're robbing homes , um , drug trafficking , you know but I just think Meadville need stuff for our children .
3 You never thought about drugs ago in Meadville .
2 No ! !
3 But way back because they used to do they do n’t do that . But now they ’re out there on the street trying to bring people in . Kids in .
2 I I think that ’s the only complaint I have in Meadville , because the hospitality is very nice for Meadville .
1 Yea that ’s why I said it be like home .
2 Meadvilles beautiful , um …
1 Getting along with a lot of people .
2 ight , I I think that the main thing I do n’t like about Meadville .
A long long lime ago they had a segregation , but now that they broke up the segregation , and now they ’re hand in Where before in the years back there was . A long time ago like back , back in the 60s and the ...
2 But that was everywhere , that want just Meadville .
3 But then they got rid of it .
I think that my chief complaint in Meadville . Other than that I love Meadville . Um , but to wanna move somewhere now , I love Meadville its my home town .
1 Yea I would wanna be in Meadville you know the grandkids could get an education here .
2 Yea , there ’s just nothing for children here , nothin . Nothin at all . I think that would be the biggest thing I would want Meadville to work on is something for our children .
you could go up there to Shady Brook , Heidi Cooper , parks up by the school , a lot of parks , and    there ai n’t hardly any parks anymore and um they like I said um Allegheny had a lot of their students that would open up the parks and they would just have crafts and games , and I used to have to go drag my children home because they would be up there , I think that ’s my biggest problem .
2 Yea I think Allegheny has done , Allegheny students has done a lot , for our children , um like that ramp um for say that ramp um Allegheny students come down and built that ramp for my husband . If it was n't   for them building that ramp , it took us a good 20 minutes to get homer out of the house .
3 I ’m not quit sure I I ca n’t I ca n’t recall it
2 Um they help the handicapped   and the elder you now if the elder needed a roof done the Allegheny   students did that and ...
1 Habitat for Humanity ?
3 And they go in and they paint houses for people .
2 No ...
2 Um I do n’t know the name of it but they just they do , I , the only people that do a lot for our community is the Allegheny students , I must say if it was n’t for the Allegheny students
2 Yup , it , I , I I prop all the students up there , I truly do . They built my ramp for my husband .
Meadville tribune was here too I ’m crying I was so overwhelmed because I ’m like my god There was times where ...... 'Cause it was a burden to get him out of the house so …
2 Yea I think that ’s my , that ’s my main focus .
1 And they do n’t have no curfews now .
2 And you see all these young children and they just hang at country fair .
1 Yup .
2 Yea .
1 And they do n’t have curfews . Do they ...
2 What ’s that ?
1 They do n’t have curfews no more .
2 No they used to have curfews , they do n’t .
2 It says " how might we improve the strength of our community ? "
That ’s a really hard answer . n’t think we have a bad community . n’t think our community is not strong , because if there is somebody in need
2 I dunno .
3 A lot of older people are afraid to walk downtown . Nowadays compared to what it was last year .
I guess for your question where its says , " if you were in control of the cities budget , what would you improve ? I think again I think I would improve the funds for them to do stuff with our children . I can remember growing up ....
1 Transportation
3 Yea but I , I also would improve the the more more for the sidewalks for the blind people too .
2 They ’re doing that the ...
3 The sidewalks are bad and uh they need more improvement . Because if I was disa .. I ’m not disabled but I ca nt I would n’t be able to walk downtown I got one of those jazzys , which I got ta get a battery for yea
2 Yea the sidewalks are bad .
3 I do n’t think I could do that on the sidewalks with the jazzy ....
1 You got ta walk in the street .
3 They tried to take him downtown in the wheelchair ....
2 Actually you ’re right because I witness when I ’m working at the store ill see a lot of elderlys driving their jazzys in the road so …
3 Yea because the sidewalks ai n’t ai n’t ai n’t cape ... Or ai n’t good for them , jazzys or anything .
2 Yea we tried pushing him downtown in a wheelchair and its difficult
3 She could n’t get it through the uh rough parts of its cement of the uh ... Sidewalk
2 We had to pull him backwards .
3 And they , I think they need more room the sidewalks . For the blind and the elderly , I really do .
3 There ’s a lot of stuff that they need to do that uh they ...
3 Yea it one thing the blinded have the the canes they have the ball ; they would n’t be able to walk down there . Because the ball would get stuck in prolly one of these holes or ruts .
2 I think that ’s the only thing I have a problem in in Meadville I ’m not dishappy ...
3 I ’m not unhappy about Meadville , I like living here .
2 I love Meadville I love it here , um I just that ’s the main thing if I were to be able to do somethin I would focus on something for children , especially poverty children , and we have a lot that here . We really do .
3 I want to focus on I want for the blind to ...
2 Well yea , but I ’m saying I want for children too mom , there ’s a lot of them that hang on the streets and get in trouble and ...
3 I know I know and its not good for them ..
2 There ’s nothing for them to do .
2 eally ?
1 Is that bad ?
2 It never used to be like that either , like I said you could leave your doors unlocked at night and go to bed and sleep sound and knowing ....
3 I lock all my windows and doors .
’s car , but they robbed here car . Actually my grandson was having a sleepover and they were all camping out front before the ramp was built , and they were all had their sleeping bags stuff on the porch
3 I ’d be afraid to been outside .
2 I think that ’s the only , problem I have with Meadville . That I I must prop and I do n’t know where to go to prop you Allegheny students but you guys do a lot for our community .
1 Yea
2 Allegheny does do a lot for the community they really do . Many things . I ca n’t even think of all the stuff they do but .
2 That ’s wonderful there too yea . You know what , you ’re right , um , my brother goes every year and the the income tax Allegheny students help with income tax , do the income tax .
1 Yea at the library ?
2 I really do n’t have any more to add that ’s ...
that you know we need more stuff for children to do .
3 Your grandchildren ai n’t all grown up .
2 Well they ’re …
3 Antwon ai n’t and neither is Devante .
2 No I ’m talking about the ones that are n’t hanging on the street that have are able to go out by themselves and be able to do something .
3 ight .
2 The little ones ca nt , but that ’s my main focus I would wanna say is for the children .
1 Mmhmm .
2 Yea and what about , out summer days um when they used to have the sidewalk sales downtown . I mean , we we ’ve got businesses .
3 There ai n’t no down town anymore .
2 We do have businesses downtown .
3 Not a whole lot .
They used to all get together ’d look forward that it would be the whole weekend and they would have a little carnival and stuff like that down there , um , and I ca nt remember what it was called , but it was always in , august …
They had the diamond park closed off for our teens and had bands going up there They do n’t do that anymore , you do n’t see no downtown sidewalks anymore , no carnivals downtown …
1 Nothin .
2 Nothin . Sometimes you wonder if Meadvilles becoming a ghost town …
Chelsea Lee Tucker
Um , it its a place where you can get help for mental illness .
And they also give you shelter for homelessness .
Um , I think that ’s about it .
No , just since before Christmas for like two days .
I think so yea .
Um , the help .
Mmmm , the people .
They ’re nice .
No nothing .
CVS , Walgreens , uh , the mall .
And um the read program .
Hush . I ’m not quite sure .
I want go there .
It is . I want to um read better , do math better , do social studies and science better .
It will help me pass exam like the SATs and the uh exam to get into college .
I ’m thinking about going for CNA to help be an N.
Well , um , I saved two people in my lifetime , and I liked doing it so ...
Well my sister was drowning in a swimming pool . Uh , this guy I brought home ended up with a car that fell on top of him ...
Um , they help you to learn how to live independently .
The help .
Um , learning to live independently .
The confusion of walking around .
Having somebody who can walk around with me .
Everything being in like the same block .
Um . I made some good friends here .
Um no that ’s it .

**excerpts:**
I love all the fun things you can do with friends and family and all the activities you can participate in , and I feel it 's like a strong little community . That we all work together and have fun .
What matters to me most is my friends here . Because I feel friends ( and a lot of my family is here too ) , friends and family are a very important thing in your life .
My favorite memory about living in Meadville is probably playing baseball and doing all these fun games at baseball .
Some stuff to make living here easier would be cutting taxes , creating more jobs , and making it so we 're more of a more strong economic ... economy .
Probably all the history we have , because our history dates clear back to the 1700s . And there 's just so many things you can do like the Baldwin eynolds House , and even Diamond Park is history .
Probably if everybody just left that were my friends it would make me miss Meadville . Like if all the activities were gone like bowling and putt-putt it would not be Meadville anymore .
Probably strong friendships and the fair . The fair creates lots of money for us and its a fun activity too that needs to keep on going as a tradition .
I want them to experience all the things you can do like bowling and like even some of the restaurants like Eddies and Casey 's . They need to experience that local charm .
My one wish for Meadville would be to make all the houses look nice .

I 'd say what I love most about the city of Meadville is that it has all of the attractions and items of a much larger town , but it has a very small-town , family-friendly oriented community .
I am a teacher , so what matters most to me would be not only having a great education system for my children , but also an education system that I am proud to work in . That is what matters most to me about that .
My favorite memory would probably have to be the Crawford County Fair . That is something that I look forward to the most each year from the time I was 8 years old . So I would say my strongest memory is the Crawford County Fair .
We also have two children , so having a great family atmosphere and a family-friendly town was important to us as we raised our family . Our families grew up here in this area and we 're happy to be around them , and stay in a great community .
As I said my husband is in manufacturing , so seeing a good , solid base in the economy would be something that would make us stay here .
I would say , knowing the president of the Chamber , I think she 's doing an amazing job providing events and opportunities for both small and larger businesses within the community . Also making Meadville very community centered I think she does a great job of that .
I think something that I of course would miss a lot would be the Crawford County Fair , if it was n't here .
A strong education system obviously . So between a strong education system and also jobs that people can have that people can make a good honest living off of will keep people here , and keep the town thriving .
What draws us here and keeps us here is all the items of a large town but in a much smaller community oriented . I want them to be able to have all the great memories that my husband and I share .
I would probably go with newer buildings versus all the effort and time and money that it would take to restore a lot of these historical places .

I would say that if there 's an event , it 's nice that it 's a small enough community that you can read about it in the paper I like the small community feel , And with the MCA , I like when they offer shows and stuff there . And i think the market house is a real asset to this community .

That was a big reason for it . And I 've been able to stay because I 've had a lot of interesting opportunities come my way . There 's definitely ways to get involved . Family is really the reason for that .
I love how Voodoo has actually bought one , and is potentially going to open it up so we can see that brewing process . I love that those spaces are still there . I love how affected the community was by the dismantling of the Talon factory .
Oh my gosh , the Market House . That would be , I do n't even know what i would do without the Market House . I mean I could tell you a couple things I could go without , but the Market House is essential .
I 'm sure a lot of people say that . It 's like one of the key things .
Well I think that one of the things is we really need to invest in our small businesses .

I love all the fun things you can do with friends and family and all the activities you can participate in , and I feel it 's like a strong little community . That we all work together and have fun .

**excerpts:**
So like name and everything ? So , Alex Giles . 24 Caucasian male . That 's a pretty good physical description . Umm , charismatic I never used to think of myself that way but I guess I turned into a pretty charismatic guy .
In Meadville or in general ? or both ?
" wow now i 'm like managing this place and have full control over this place and do it how i wanna Here specially because I went to high school here
Just one but it was a franchise . It was in southern NH and it was called Myriad Games . I stopped working there about January 2014 , that 's when he closed the doors on all his stores and let everyone go .
I guess we got our EIN in Feb of 2016 so it 's kinda like it became a trademark business name then but was n't until the 7th of November in 2016 that the doors actually opened and we found a place .
But once it was in full swing , there were like couple nights where people were having to switch out with other people just to sit down and play games and some people
14 may have been the youngest and that was Glen and now he 's like 15 . I guess Justin and Matt 's age which is like around 40 . so it really brings a real age range in there .
So video games have this entrusting market around them where GameStop and Walmart and
like when the family got a modern computer and AOL was still a thing and Internet Explorer was the number one browser . I was doing stuff like that , playing Counter Strike , playing very free games , played World of Warcraft for a long time and it just kind of translated through growing up , was a single kid for the most part or like an only child .
Sure , of course .
it 's really really easy to let emotions get the better of you for the most part . So like take the worst gaming community like League of Legends or DOTA or something like that , like the worst , just garbage like toxic communities , I 've never seen anything near something like that for board games .
So instead of living in the apartment building we were in New Hampshire and going to school there . So a year and half combined like 5.5 year .

One of those people who are like , " man why is this good thing happening to me ? That kinda thing . This is n't gon na be forever , this is n't gon na be for more than a couple months " and
Thank you !
I guess with this pessimistic outlook and really hoping that things go so well for me really pushes me to do more and try more and to try and further the business to any means possible .
and they 're just surrounded by all these other people , it 's where people   go who in are n't just happy to see me or the store but the other people inside the store too .
but-like minis players might not like MAGIC the gathering players they are segmented by day because that makes the most out of the space and keeps people happy .
Because only so many kids can make the football team or play basketball . Go to the park , there were community based things all the time but at the same time I was a younger age . In Meadville it does seem like there are community based events for ages 6 - 12 like days at the MAC where you can go and swim or like the ice rink opens up and has a kids day but again for these high school kids

Because only so many kids can make the football team or play basketball . Go to the park , there were community based things all the time but at the same time I was a younger age . In Meadville it does seem like there are community based events for ages 6 - 12 like days at the MAC where you can go and swim or like the ice rink opens up and has a kids day but again for these high school kids
There were a lot of questions and a whole lot of the " board games ? I do n't understand why you gon na sell board games ? why would anyone wanna sit around and play board games ?
just cut out the need for another employee and kinda lowered my ideal space , that kinda thing . so i was looking for loans and as much money as i could for a 24 year old kid that really wanted to start his own business .
I have a couple volunteers that help out if i ever get sick or leave early for something , they 're wonderful and they come in the store
Oh yeah , for sure . As you go up in age there 's usually more beards that come in here .
say immaturity because that 's not a fair term and we have two of the most mature level headed high schoolers i have ever met in my life , but there have been groups of high school age kids that will come in here and buy like cards against humanity
I 'd say noticeable college students , not just college aged but actual students that are participating in university or higher education are very infrequent . I think the last memorable one before you was an Allegheny student who was graduating 2 - 3 weeks ago And the ones that Professor Wiebel or his wife Vesta have sent here or have pointed out have been maybe a dozen in the past six months , the actual memorable faces .
But yeah , i guess people are on phones and tablets pretty often . So as far as media goes i guess Facebook would be the big one for us .
I moved into a new apartment and I really wanted it . ( Both laugh )
During boardgame nights and stuff we would do Wil Wheatons Table Topped which was a YouTube series about boardgames , and I would put that on during those nights .
So that s a buddy of mine from a long time ago , his name is Mathew M. and he s a really awesome awesome dude . He works for Hagen industries which is a company that specializes in networking and i guess software development for larger companies .
It seems localized for the most part . and that is a very big part of the community . So the MAGIC community is very much media-centric .
, i m gon na take out my phone and browse through Facebook " because that 's what i see other people doing . SO there 's a lot of technology that 's always there .
and it were to catch on fire for some unknown reason . I 've always been very ... like .. used to using Google tools and it was really important The last business I was at , our point of sale system was through a website called Merchant OS
The MAGIC community is a wonderful community and i 've been a part of it for a really long time . So when it comes to friends and such outside of here , there are a few times , like dinners and breakfasts and stuff like that .
More space . That is the number one thing i know the customers notice when they come in . so again more space , right now we are at about 750 Square feet Still staying away from electronics like video games and systems and things like that .
Thank you ! You ’re doing great too !
I was , i wanna So they went alittle crazy one day and kinda went off the deep end . It was kinda an open and shut case . Again media in that sense is n't very good but otherwise it 's been really great .
I suppose are the bigs ones .
just in the moment of like " oh nothing 's going on , i 'm just gon na pull out my phone " like things like that the daily posts and reblogs all that kinda thing .
Things like that happen , however i think with the right spin and the right uh , view point as to what technology does for us and social media does for us and connects people together .
Security cameras , stuff like that , videogame systems , personal computer , but no other real impressive technology .
I think i operate with a good balance kinda thing , like i do n't think i 've ever been ...
Just absolutely loved the experience of making this store and i 'd do it again !

# Brenda Hawkins SMM016 Transcription.docx
**sum:**
**excerpts:**
Head Start at Forest Green has lost its grant - we need it back .   Now its just going to be a regular day care . You know with Headstart , kids start when they 're 3 and its so important .
I would have had to take my youngest out there and my oldest out here - which worked because I work out here 6 days a week -
We thought at one time , we would like to see a Sam 's Club here , but we have   Walmart and we do n't need both .
Yeah , but a Sam 's Club is important to us , because we ca n't get to Erie much because we 're blind - and therefore we ca n't get the bulk stuff cheap and that sucks .
Some of the services in this county are the best as far as handicapped people go-um the Keystone Blind Association in this county is one of the best anywhere as far as I 'm concerned .
The Blind Association up here will take us shopping , to the doctor , to the drug store , and they will take my kids to the doctor , because after all , we were the one 's responsible for getting those kids to the doctor . So that 's what I 'm saying , the blind association here is awesome . And we 've been clients of the blind association for 30 years , I became a client when our oldest son Greg was - while I was pregnant with him
Yeah-well one of the things is - one time my son took us out to Walmart so we said we 'd get the bus home , which as soon as they seen us standing there with the wheel chair , they put the ramp down so that I could push him up , but they would n't assist me with it
well then we get to Forest Green and its too close to the edge of the grass or whatever , and the ramp stuck and chair stuck So they , the drivers , need to - they need to have the drivers assist with people in wheel chairs .
Greg had a stroke 9 years ago and now uses the wheelchair , before that he was just blind and he had a guide dog because of the wheelchair , it really became an issue - so that 's something that I 'd like to see changed with CATA - that they assist with getting them on and off the bus .

Yeah its a steep hill and no sidewalk . and I told CATA , when my husband or I get hit by a bus , there will be a law suit - it needs to come in , at least to the daycare if not all the way up , you know where there is a sidewalk and there is a place for us to sit and a way that I can put him on the bus .
Well , the bus-and stuff - again when we moved to Greensburgh , there was a bus that came once a day , but it did n't give us enough time to get anything done or really go anywhere - so we were stuck at home
Now holidays are the same way - but everybody deserves a holiday . But its better for us - there are other blind clients that do n't have no-one .
Um , the rec complex is good , but its - I mean if you 're on limited income - I mean its a good place to go , but its so expensive .
ight - and you ca n't bring your own food or drinks in there , so you 've got to pay for that there too
ight so you ca n't go take a picnic and go to the ec .
And again the Y is expensive - anywhere with a pool is expensive
so-um anyways , but we used to take Greg to it It was n't too expensive since you only had to pay for the kid .
emember what happened to caddie that time ?
emember when I went to that Kindergarten readiness program with Amadea - when they were talking about a truck that 's a mobile playground
ight , the unutilized space
Yeah there are trails , and you know we used to take Greg fishing down at the crick , right down there .
ight on the corner of Lincoln ave and ace Street , yeah right before the bridge .

I feel like people here are the kind that would really pull together to help one another in times of emergency .
That ’s important to me .
I loved shopping with my mom as a child I suppose it only went up one floor , but it was a big deal .
My dad showed some of his art upstairs in the art gallery – it just is a special place for me .

You used to be able to find anything and everything here shopping-wise .
I ’m guessing it has to do with the youth I see who seem to be doing things and making things happen – I hope there are more things for them to do where they have to look people in the eye and talk !
great – lots of kids went and it was fun . Sometimes they had dance contests – I think it was out Baldwin St extension somewhere .
The Market House for sure .
The sense of community .
It would be great to get back to having people shopping in Meadville and hanging out here in town .

**excerpts:**
They used to have street dances for the young kids that were like in middle school , high school . and they would close down Diamond Park , the road that went around . , it 's just a fun thing . and it was a warm feeling . I just think they need to come back and do some things like that .
My love of the MAC .
I think the MAC is a very special facility . I wish I had the staff like the YMCA does because there is so many things you could do here . But I started working here , it 'll be 35 years this April , and anyone that has ever worked at the MAC , no matter what capacity it is , I run into kids that used to work as a lifeguard or a concession attendant and they tell me ' this was our first job , and we loved it ' and you get bitten by the MAC . I think we could do a really fantastic job if we could afford to have like a program director , and a lot more positions than what we have . that 's in a supervisor position , and we have our staff meetings and
But I think the stores . A lot of the stores downtown You could walk in to the drug store , or jewelry store , and everybody knew everybody 's name . But everybody knew everybody . And I think back then everybody looked our for everybody .
I do love Diamond Park . It reminds me of the old movie Peyton Place , which is probably way before your time .
and I said to him ' sometimes as we 're growing up , people forget what the important things in life are . , that do good things , but unfortunately , there 's only so many people here that can donate money
I think if Meadville could go and make the downtown , like I love going into the bank . I think that is a great place to go and look and shop .
I think it 's different . People are friendly when you go in there . I have to be honest with you , I have n't been in there for a while . But when they had the coffee shop in there . Do they still have it ?
, they have a candle store and you can see them making the candles and things like that . I 've always wanted to go to the New England states , and I envision the stores like that up there .
I hate to say this , but I do not like Walmart . and I feel bad , a lot of times I go to Kmart even if I have to pay more because I think when Kmart goes out , Walmart is gon na be the only thing here . But if you could get like a Target , a Kohls , somebody to come in . Even here , we sell just a few things , we used to have a pro shop that sold hockey equipment , figure skating stuff and swimming stuff . Stuff like that .
and it 's definitely your family and your friends And there 's not somebody staying home . We had , not so much right now , but there for a while we had quite a few fathers that were stay at home dads and the wives worked .
I can remember when my husband and I were first married , he always worked second or third shift , and I did n't work until all my kids were in elementary school , and that s when i started here .
Have you talked to your girlfriend about this ?
and I ran into 6 people , 6 young people that used to work here at the funeral I said I just love seeing your family pictures on FB .
There 's a lot of stories that could be told . That 's what I love about this place . And I mean , and just as you think that nobody that could come and ask you something that you 've never heard of , it happens .
Did I ever tell you about the fish ? Well the parks and rec had playgrounds .
Yeah . The one that they put the rocks on .
I mean he was just the cutest thing and The kids were out on the ice , he ran out there and just flung this thing . Everybody just screamed because they thought it was the real thing . He said ' I will never do another thing ' .
He had one of the girls go in the bathroom , he gave he a quarter to get it . He was something .

**excerpts:**
I am Christina Katrina Tobin .
I like the fact that it 's a medium sized town . There 's enough stuff here where i   do n't really have to go outside of it to meet my needs .
Interesting to me ?
Well like to stay in this area ? Lives are busy , there are only so many hours in a day . so i can get everything i need without having to go more than a half hour away . Everything is right here .
Aldis is my main go to spot .
Well i was born here , my roots are here . And I m petrified to leave , that s the honest answer .
Well my family is from around here . We 're farmers . My dad is from Cambridge Springs area , i went to Maplewood . We 're just all from this general area . So we 've just always been around here .
My dad was a farmer his entire life . He bought his farm when he was 19 years old . And he farmed his entire life .
He had a dairy farm . I grew up on the largest farm in crawford county .
The Farm is still here . Unfortunately , it is not still farmed . It 's just land now , it just sits there .
When   326   foreclosed . And the Mennonites bought it   for pennies on the dollar .
Because the price of milk dropped and the price of produce dropped and it was no longer .. I was 11 so it was ' 91 when it happened .
Well industry took over , ya know big industry . And it was no longer even .. You could n't even put food on the tables .. It was no longer a profit thing . IF you just could n't even survive .
He started raising   chinchillas for pelts .
Not really . Because after that my parents split up , and it was all like single mom trying to work two jobs kind of thing .
I guess that 's what actually brought us into Meadville . My parents split up and we came into town and lived in Fairmont government housing because mom was trying to work two jobs .
Well the college definitely is a lot of what captures the spirit of this town . The first thing i do when i describe what this town is , i say its a college town .
I like the kids walking the streets and them coming and going at certain times of the year and knowing the jobs are shifting . It 's something you know is happening and it 's part of what is coming and going .
Yeah , it 's something you know is part of the town . It 's just part of being here and it 's just something that is part of the community .
Define " this " .
My kid is in tenth grade now and I 'm realizing And that 's something that I guess I really just took for granted that everybody had . and i think that 's another they took out the farming aspect .
I have no idea why .
I think what they did is they took it more towards the landscaping .
And i wanted to make sure to mention that today and how great last year i saw little spots of community gardens and the one you guys put up here last year and that was awesome that those were out .
That is cool to me because it is a community project . And I think the way to " save the world " is for the community to come together . It 's the communities , its the little things ,
It 's a physical representation of people coming together .
Not that i ve seen .
The one thing that I remember that I miss the most and that I wish was back is cruising . Such a simple thing that I wish my kid had . And like some place for the teenagers to go .
She 's 16 .
In her basement on electronics .
And that 's usually what she says . We were n't doing anything wrong , we were just driving in circles . And people knew where we were . We were easily watched . It does n't matter where teenagers are at .
I know there s been a couple dance things they 've tried to do and i can think of two in particular they 've tried in the last 5 years or so . That 's the only thing I can think of right off the top of my head .
Well we went around the Diamond , in front of the movie theater .
The one downtown ?
Yeah , the one that 's the dollar cinema now or whatever . Friday and Saturday night for like two hours or something , parked at the Diamond .
Talk . Act like teenagers .
Just chill .
Exactly . Like and it was before the time of cell phones . So if you wanted to know where someone was at , you wanted to look for somebody , they 're at the Diamond . That s where everybody 's at .
, it was everybody 's windows in their cars were rolled down . It was n't just everyone driving around with their windows rolled up , everybody just cooped up in their own little space .
i just want her to be able to get out and have fun and do things , and that 's what this town does not have . I 've got ta take her to Erie or some place else for her to get out and do things .
In this town ?
Nah this town has always been pretty dry for teenagers .
As far as entertainment goes ?
Um .. the college has offered quite a few times fun entertainment . We 've gone to a few concerts up there Um Ernst Trail has provided many evenings of great entertainment .
Um , the new movie theater coming into town was quite nice . We do n't honestly go out a lot and do a whole lot of out type entertainment . Mostly because we fall on that nice little category of .. what do you call that ?
Yeah for the most part . My daughter is quite involved in the academy theater .
See if you would n't have asked me ..
She 's been involved for the last year or so .
She auditioned for Beauty and the Beast and got really upset with the process .
They 've been going to Allegheny College and have been doing stuff there . But her and her best friend do a lot of that kind of stuff together .
Sometimes . I m usually the taxi . I need a hat .
I have a really awesome memory of when my kid was little , like 2 or 3 , Easter time at the Market House . and she had made a little apple , Squeeze made her a little apple out of a balloon . They had the Market House all decorated up for Easter , that was 14 years ago
Well it definitely says that Market House is something that we value and take care of and that we make sure to draw people in for holidays and celebrate young children and families and those types of things .
I do still go to the Market House . I was there just a   couple weeks ago as a matter of fact .
I was there for breakfast with friends then we shopped around for a little bit .
I have been above the Market House . My daughter has taken classes there for artsy things .
No new sightings , no construction of any sort . So last year when I started seeing like new sighting and new , like um , road construction and professional type construction and stuff like that and things actually happening , ya know that was a little encouraging to me
but even if she just did regular cosmetology , that 's bigger cities and things of that sort as well .
I do n't know . I really do n't know the answer to that question . I am in a process of personal transition and I do n't have a good answer .
That is definitely the spot for teenagers . and this is the spot . Some place they wanna go , some place they wanna be that they can . Ya know , there used to be a pool hall in this town . It was a cool spot .
I do n't think they 're treated like they 're people . And f we treated them like they were actual people with actual opinions , we would actually get wonderful things from them because they are amazing , wonderful creatures with amazing , wonderful minds .
I got the gardens in , I got the teenagers thing in . I think those were the two big things I wanted to make sure to touch on .
They are definitely the generation that is going to be able to do something .

Big town feel . Small town living .
It provides me with all the services that I need because its big enough population wise but small enough that I do n't have to worry about not knowing my neighbors personally .
24 hour shopping .
None of its volunteer .
Low crime .
Pause …   I do n't know if I have a favorite memory .
I like going to the downtown Meadville Days in the summer whatever they 're called .
My job .
I work for Warner Kline Machine out of Erie Pennsylvania .   I transferred down here because the person running the Crawford County Office , um , got a much better job so I was able to jump up the company ladder , really fast really far simply by taking the position in Crawford County rather than staying in the city of Erie .
Again , small town feel with bigger town amenities .
That ’s what would make it easier .
I do n't want the city government looking over my shoulder on everything I do on my private property .
No not really . I would hope that being a smaller town that they would n't create laws in a politically correct vein just to satisfy their image .
What things ?
I can go anywhere in this country and say the word Channel Lock and everybody knows what I 'm talking about and that ’s all here .
What would I miss ?
Channel Lock
The manufacturing base here , the design base .
Umm , to attract more manufacturing and maybe less service oriented jobs .
Um , self-reliance , self-sufficiency .
Primary education .
I would say they provide a good , I would n't say they provide an excellent or outstanding , its good .
Um , allocating resources to students can actually benefit from it .
Those need more money .
The weather
Do you mean , I do n't know , Meadville 's Government to make it better ? Or ...
That they spend their tax revenue wisely and not on silly things .
I would much rather have Liberty Street paved .

And plus all of the murals down there make it a happier place .
They traveled to Hershey to play for the State Championship and they lost
The athletics is probably my favorite part but also my family . A lot of my family lives in Meadville so I mean , that 's also a good aspect of it .
May ... ok ... the people that , some people here are really ignorant about everything so probably the less ignorant people around would make it easier staying here .
Umm ... I guess maybe I could just ignore them all the time but some people get to me , so ...
The Market House , downtown is definitely an older building so I mean that actually does capture the whole meaning of Meadville as in the whole downtown because they are all old buildings so I mean .
The history 's great but I feel like they should start upgrading things because as time goes on people are going to be more about technology and not about the past .
I do n't believe any of children or grandchildren are going to be visiting Meadville at any time so ...
Because I would like to get out of here and experience bigger and better things in the world .
I think they should add a better youth system for all of the younger kids .

What matters ? What matters to me most , uh , probably uh , the people , I 'd say . I do n't think the town would be the same without the people that live in Meadville .
My en- My entire life , I 'd say .
Probably uhm , like they tore , they took the playground down to like , you know what I mean , like down by Allegheny highland park . Is that what it is ? I put , I remember like as a little kid playing down there a lot .
Well , I was , well I am in a high school , so mainly my parents . Just living there generally .
What brought me here ? Well , well , kinda just my parents . My parents moved here and uh , yeah . Just never moved out .
Why did I stay ? Main- Mainly 'cause I just , well like my entire family , really I should say , just liked the town of Meadville in general really .
Kinda probably going back to what I said before , about [ unknown ] like the people that live here , just like , just like the neighbors , people , the people in school , the students , teachers and stuff .
Yeah , a friendly community .
Make staying here easier ?
and there are a lot of things to do . But like if , like if you could add more things to do . Like , I do n't know , I do n't know what you could add considering those already a good , pretty good amount of stuff
Captures the spirit of .... probably like uhm like the sports teams , like Meadville Bulldogs and like all , like all , like all the students come out to all the games and stuff just like really support the team and show a lot of spirit for , spirit for the team in general . Allegheny College as well , like , like Allegheny College is in Meadville , and like having a college in Meadville , which is n't that very big of a town .
And also some of the things that are around here , like the Diamond , th- the Diamond were- were n't here , Diamond Park it probably would n't feel like Meadville anymore if that was n't there .
But , if the peop- if the people were there Because they would n't hav- because there would n't be a whole load of new people . If the people that lived in Cambridge were still there .
I 'm not saying they do n't matter , I 'm just say- Like if you took out like , like the town hall for example , like it obviously that 'd have an effect in it , but I 'd s- but I 'd say the people m-
and like try to keep a whole load of crimes and bad things out of the , out of the town .

I was never huge on sports like I played basketball for a little bit
everywhere you go you can learn , can learn something differently and do something differently . And I feel like the way Meadville does like teaches athletics and music and any other extra-curriculars like clubs and other things like that
but I do n't have a whole load of knowledge about like how the other like schools work , like how Conneaut or Cambridge , as you said , like how they function to like actually like put it into words .
not a whole lot of stuff going on there . I have n't been to a whole load of the stores ,

Um , my family and the family business that we have in Meadville . And I stay because I ’m not old enough to move alone , outside of the city yet .

Um , and also it 's easier to find clubs to join and other things to provide service to others .
um ... I think ... what would make things here a li ... living here easier would be ... uh ... if it was just easier maybe to get out , and to do more community service so hat the community can grow as a whole .
I would say uh Baldwin eynolds house is definitely a great place of history . uh , th the history and the ... great things that Meadville has to offer .
so if you , if those things are kind gone than it just seems too ... make Meadville seem ... blah .
during Pat 's sentence Yeah ... yeah
Um , I say community service is a great thing . you know I think it 's great to introduce more community service opportunities into Meadville .
uh , I experienced a lot of joy growing up in Meadville and I 've noticed you know like you look to Erie or Pittsburgh or the other bi , big cities and people have to continually worry about their safety but here you do n't have to .

One thing ? Laughs . My name is   Kedzierski laughs , umm , oh gosh , umm one thing is tough , and I …
interrupting
I know , and I , um , and I also feel like I have different experiences because of having grown up here and then having been away and having come back .
and I think about my childhood differently than I think about things now . Um , I think , for an event in meadville that I think of is the parade , I would always consider the parade as the one event that brings out everybody in Meadville .
the people , the different groups or certain groups , certain different groups that are the same every time , and um , how ’ll they ’ll be some changes each year but it 's ... you ...


but I um , did my undergrad in Erie at Penn State . but when I went to grad school I went to Virginia Commonwealth University in ichmond , and clears throat stayed there after I got my degree and started a family down there , um , but my husbands from Erie so we have been , probably even before we had our kids were looking to come back to the area , me not ever thinking it would be meadville because I did n't think we would ever find jobs here . but then I was working for the state of Virginia doing wetland and stream permitting um , and I found that everyone , when I eventually somehow got a ernst seed catalogue everybody that was doing wetland and stream restoration were buying seeds from ernst , and one day I finally turned the catalogue over and saw their address because I did n’t know anything about them before I left and saw that it was in Meadville , and then at the time my husband had um , worked for the Virginia state seed lab , um , and was also working at the Virginia State University seed resorch , search station , and , so he had a background in seeds , and uh , so I saw this and said , I had been the one looking for a job cause I was the one with a master ’s degree I just looked up who was the , um , chair of Environmental Science at Allegheny College just to meet with him to talk about opportunities there cause I knew some cause I had interned at the DEP when I was in college .
so I kinda assumed I would work somewhere like DEP so it was Jim Palmer at Allegheny and then he said I have this thing called Creek Connections and the person who ’s running it for me is looking to go back to get her master ’s In September I started working for creek connections .
My parents were here his parents were in Erie so we were the only ones from both of our families to move far away , even though   7 hours is n't really that far laughs .
Yeah my perception looked , when I was looking after finishing up my master ’s degree was that , it was n’t gon na be worth my time to look specifically in Meadville because there were n’t gon na be a lot of job opportunities .
but she was younger than my dad and my dad struggled until his retirement to find a job and , a job that he liked and wanted to stay in , um , so
to have a career here .
certain people that know everybody and if you can get in and talk to just the right person and they would know ,
that you know it ’s networking , knowing the right people to get places and , , um , it ended up when I started talking to Jim Palmer at Allegheny College that he went to school at University of Pennsylvania with my boss in Virginia .
you know there were other things that I applied to here once we were moving here and nothing else worked out so You know like in Meadville going to events , it 's so easy to talk to people li when uh , like the community events that we have
it ’s very rare here um … um and now that I have teenagers they ’re struggling to find summer work and part time work that they want to ,
laughs Somewhere up by Jack ’s pharmacy , Ieeah , swear I did n’t do drugs so I was n’t in there laughs not making it up completely .
’s had different owners . It was called azzi ’s , It ’s had different names it was the Hat or , Top Hat or something . , I do n’t know the bar names , laughs , it just seemed like there were different things
Gas costs to much these days to make it laughs . if you wanna see people , and find out where parties were that ’s where you went , you do n’t have to do that anymore laughs
and they , lament the fact that it costs money , a lot of money sometimes , to go to the movies um , and they sometime do things like bowling or putt putt , um , but something that ’s not so money centered
Um , I do n’t know what it is , I do n’t think they know what it is either laughs .
, it ’s like you have to know people laughs it ’s like do n’t tell her that laughs . The one that ’s pet sitting is making a lot more money than the one that ’s babysitting .
People care about their dog more than their kids . Laughs Sometimes . Kids are already too expensive laughs .
laughs Well I think it 's also , well that and also , people do n’t value childcare ,
they do n’t wanna pay , they do n’t wanna pay for what the value of it is which should be really important .
mm hm , mm hm , I think so too .
um , I think one of the things that really bothers people but does n’t bother me is shopping stuff , cause I am not , a shopper . feel the need to have that stuff right here . Starbucks … Starbucks laughs
I like that we have little unique things .
You can go to Olive Garden anywhere , we live here now we can take you to the places that are local .
I mean the chain places are good for , at the 79 interchange , we do n’t need em … here .
um , I do n’t know there are certain things that would be nice if they were a little closer , but we 're , I do n’t know . um , I think um … that we definitely saw an impact of when Walmart came in and um , how it changed the stores around here ’re So yeah those kinda things drive me nuts um …
There ’s one every , every little town now has one now
yeah and they ’re running out ...
Probably laughs
And I think that ’s the new place that are running out the remaining mom and pop places , and i think that ’s horrible . it does n't make it so inaccessible to other places that have other things .
French creek laughs for sure , for sure french creek . I think Allegheny College obviously Allegheny College . like you know , we have Irish people and now it 's not and it 's um ... people are more together about that kinda stuff um ,
No I grew up at St. Agatha 's but ... no laughs but not anymore laughs . yeah my moms family was , grew up in that .

um , there 's got ta be something , people will do for this regardless . um , I think would influence people 's decisions um ... um ... lost in background noise .
I help a lot of other people be connected and um ...
whatever they call em , the planning ... plan , the strategic plan , something like that um , for the woodcock creek area the army core of engineers the whole lake area . And there 's now a bus stop out maybe at , either at woodcock or at like Ice Cream Cottage um , from from the CATA line so from Meadville .
That opens up a whole ' nother nature recreating area to people .
, I do n't know if the , if the drop of point is um , ice cream cottage area um , it 's they have now the Saegertown line so that whatever services needs ...
and I think they 've found enough , been involved in enough things found enough that they would , you know be able to walk into so many stores and know the owners and , be able to say hello , um ...
More ... more bigger places with secure jobs .
Um , but when we lost all the big um ... employer , the big steady employers all , in this short time frame um ... , i know the tool and die industry is big here

Merit , I think the balloon festival , I think that 's when you think of Meadville something that you always , think about , and I know that 's something that we 've always gone to . That would probably be the one thing that comes to mind .
It 's something unique and different that you ca n't find in other areas .
Well I guess watch the balloons . laughs
We 're boring .
Um ... the small community atmosphere , I think that 's I mean we 're Cochranton there is because of the community and um , Meadville 's the big city laughs when your in Cochranton
Safe environment .
Uh , nice place to raise family .
I think for the most part . I think it 's changed over the years but now you here all the different stories of things that happen so you , are a little bit more hesitant .
Well um ... like the up at Walmart , they just had that incident where the lady was gettin ' followed around and , again just different .
Creepier things that never used to happen 25 years ago laughs . And there seems to be more violence in the community than there was 25 years ago .
I 've been in Cochranton my whole life ,
and then , I worked in Meadville ... College I worked in Meadville , Um , I 've been in Venango County the last five years but , other than that I 've basically always worked in the Meadville area .
Closeness to home . Um you ca n't find anything much more closer than laughs . Especially in Cochranton there 's not much , not many jobs .
So , I 'm in Meadville .
The same reason you know it 's close , um you know it 's a quick easy drive and the jobs are decent so , why go anywhere else I guess .
We do shopping . Again there 's not many options in Cochranton so we when you need something you end up running to Meadville . And it 's not that bad of a , you know fifteen minutes and you 're there .
so we do n't you know um , we 've got a movie theater in town now so we do n't use the theater to much in here . Uh we used to go to the rec complex , so ...
Uh more children activities and events . But it would be nice if there was more opportunities for them . Um , there 's so many opportunities for dance and gymnastics and that stuff but it all comes with a hefty fee too .
Um ... just like little I do n't know like activity days type thing , different things like that .
I think those are nice events , and the downtown mall . they did a few years ago did it , a um like multicultural event , and they had different stations set up in the downtown mall and you could go and do activities at each one
Where there 's different activities for the kids to do .
yeah it 'd be nice to have some kinda ... dance program or something that did n't cost so much you know laughs .
Mm hm .
Um , we 've done the dance , and payed and arm and a leg laughs .
Um ... the Y , does a lot of nice programs we 've done a lot of the Y programs we 've done the gymnastics and the tee ball and the soccer because they 're short term
Or is like , the sporting teams the tee ball like , through the little leagues are more , so yeah we 've done   the Y programs we 're pretty happy with those .
yeah and the emphasis on the child having a good time and enjoying it not , being pressured to always be the winner .
I do n't know if i would know that , especially I mean if you grew up here and went to school here and stuff , probably have a different ... I mean I could tell you that about Cochranton , you know .
And they 're always pretty good about donating stuff , different places I worked
Um , gosh I 've done a whole array of stuff ,
I mean just from getting Chinese auction donations for church , to um , doing like annual fun type projects so , I do n't know the whole way , the whole spectrum .
Yeah , you get tired of asking but ...
I 'm sure they get tired of being asked at the same time .
Well I think some of the bigger , like dads and channel lock like if they pulled out I think it definitely would affect the community just because of how many people they employ .
Um pause mm pause .
Yeah , yeah some channel lock people , and I think like , especially both of those are well known companies ,
That are in Meadville so that 's kinda like a signature , or branding type
You know that 's Meadville type ...
I blacked out , yeah I think those would , I think they would affect if either one of those companies pulled out .
I think that this My Meadville project and the different things that have spun from that um , are important like even with , what is it Dan Hunter , doin' those rose huts and things laughs but similar things like that that got people excited .
Probably because , they 're probably lookin ' for something free too laughs .
But , I mean it got them out in the community and it was a great move on his part for promoting his business too I mean they were all lookin ' on Facebook waiting for him .
So , I just think it was a neat , neat idea that he came up with .
Mm hm . We used to when they he was in Cochranton one time we ,
We , we went out and ... I mean it was a neat little scavenger hunt too .
I 'll have to convince him to go to Cochranton again laughs .
No not right now .

Oh boy .
I think it 'd be nice to see indiscernible I mean there was a while where the down town was just kinda , abandoned type thing .
but , I always think that would be nice if we had some sort of bigger department stores and stuff that you typically have to run to Erie for .
Yeah , for Hermitage or Butler .
Um , just cause like , places like Sam 's Club , you can only get so much at Walmart laughs .
So , and even like the department stores and that kinda stuff , again Walmart has its limits .
Or you end up going on Amazon .
Mm hm .
Well like you used to go down to chestnut street and there was so many empty places and um , park avenue ... and it just seems like some of those store and businesses   are getting revitalized and um , some of the activities that are happening like the second Saturdays at the Market House and um , do n't they do that band thing too ?
they did it on top of a , what was it a garage ...
Yeah yeah I mean they 're doing more activities to get people to come downtown and I think that 's pretty important .
It 's almost like two little mini towns for our new township and then downtown .
Um , cause so much for years was growing in Vernon township and like , your grocery , just bigger grocery stores and mean you could very feasibly have to do everything in Vernon township and never set foot in downtown .
Yeah , cause it 's not typically like I do n't , shop downtown unless I 'm looking for something specific .
Um pause . Well I guess you got Tops , I guess some of those bigger department stores . But where in the world would you put it you know laughs . So ...
No I think that 's pretty good .
Thank you , I 'm glad you were able to come in and

I love all the community events like second Saturday where you can go and have fun with your friends or family , and I like all the locally owned shops such as creative crusts and tattered corners , and I like that there is not a lot of crime here
Um my favorite memory is in the summer I would go to the farmer ’s market with my parents and then we 'd go to creative crusts and get bread and we would have tons of fun .
My dad got a job here and so we moved here and I stayed because of my parents .
Having more places to hang out with my friends and more places to shop at .
The big zipper where all the people contributed pieces to it and all the road signs out by giant eagle .
Um , creative crusts because I go there practically every weekend and its , you can just sit there and talk or you can like eat its its really nice .
Um , its important to continue community events and uh having low crime rate .
To have more shopping options like build a better mall or expand the downtown mall to have more places that teenagers would like to shop at like H&M or like forever 21 or Hollister , places like that .

I So yeah , if you um there 's a ton of different ways to get involved . So um we can talk about that too .
And then there was an absence of non market authority for it muffled . but it 's a little antiquated for this kind of thing .
I Yes . mhm but yeah I mean this is a great way to get involved . And so it 's coming out of the rebuild and so are
Overlapping talk government sanction thing or that just people organized person organized thing
I This My Meadville project ?
the- the
The redevelopment authority is a government it 's the same way the market authority is kind of under the city umbrella um but like we 're actively working to get something else on board like we 've had one of the council members join the leadership team recently like um
Now is there like something that you 're just using for your own or is it something like a poster ?
they take out the whole thing right so if you talk about certain things then they 'll say ok that fits this theme of what people are talking about . and we 're like hey but that 's up to you
, I know someone uh zoning board , I know the democratic party here , and stuff not the head of it the office where the democratic party of Meadville muffled Minute 306 I do n't want to overstate personal connections and you know what I mean is all
I Ok , no I mean so yeah
So is there a right answer or should I start with like it was a misty afternoon in May 1991 when I was born or should I try that ?
I laughs   Well we do have some uh uh muffled so uh Jack and Marv .... well you can answer them all together you could just be part of the conversation , Jack what is your last name ?
Muffled so technically my first name is John
I mean but no one calls you John
ight but I mean
I No it 's however you wanna , Marv what 's your last name ?
I Cool um so you 've been in Meadville for a long time
Yeah this is year 26
I Ok So did you always live in the city
yeah well West Mead but right up from the hospital up Leighton oad right up there
I Yeah , and do you live around there now ?
No so technically we live in an apartment right behind McDonald 's but we just purchased a house .
I eally ? Congratulations , wow .
We 'll be living on Column , right below the college
I Yeah , cool . That 's a nice neighborhood .
It 's a nice neighborhood , it 's got it 's since it used to be like an all Allegheny apartments and stuff too it 's really turning into more like younger families moving in
Yeah , because the college changed the way their living arrangements were on campus and stuff so like now you have to stay there unless you have like certain privileges your senior year , and that 's like the only time you can move off campus in the college
So now they move like families in there , it 's really awesome
Cuz there was even , there was even a house that two of my friends had lived in that was like a six seven person apartment that 's now for sale a whole house . " ok that 's not going to be seven college kids living there
I The one on Column that has like stairs that go up yeah I 've had friends that live there
I was going to say , I feel like
If you went down I spent my last two years of college at Allegheny so I graduated from
I ok what year ?
I now have to study journalism like tv production like um everything yeah and that was my last 8 credits , it was kind of a let down
I So were you Comm arts
Communications and political science uh political science was my minor but that 's but I was like I do n't want to spend that much more money plus the scholarship you get for being from Meadville you get like a $ 10,000 scholarship
I Oh really ?
Yeah for each year for two years if you 're like from the area it 's like you just through an endowment but I was like cuz they were like " you have to live on campus " and I was like " uh excuse me
I So uh mar you said you been living here for a year
A little bit over do n't you think
This summer will be two years so
I So where were you before
Clarion at Clarion College
I Did you guys meet at Clarion
Attended at Clarion laughs
I Yeah but when you were in the Clarion area , that when you
Well he came he was going , he 'd already gradated , and we met and um I was still living in Clarion and he came up there for muffled
I That 's funny because this project used to be called Heart and soul anyways laughs that 's cool so uh you 've been here for you 've been living in town for a year and a half
Yeah we lived on park ave at first and then that February , we moved down to the apartment we 're in now we 've been there since
I And so you were from Clarion
I am not
Yeah her situations a little more
I was born in Clearfield I have lived in muffled ridgeway and uh waynesboro and Pittsburgh
I ok
And you lived in Connecticut or Deleware
I Yeah so now you 're
Went to Erie college um and I lived there throughout college and then even like my senior year I took classes muffled
that 's really big and stuff we 're hoping to get an opportunity to go back somewhere and finish her degree or do something else they have a program too at college for women overlapping talk
Yeah that would be really awesome
Cuz like I do n't know how
I Yeah
the thing works with the Meadville scholarship I do n't know if you have a certain amount of time to get there or what
probably I 'm not sure , I think you have to be a resident
This would be a big deal especially with where we live she could walk everyday to the college
I Yeah Column 's right there I know a psych professor that lives on Column street . who has a young kid
My favorite professor I ever had lives on Column too , uh professor Christy-Searles
I oh yeah yeah
Yeah he was awesome
I Well he uh did you hear what his plans are ?
I mean this guy has done everything and like can do anything and that 's why it 's so remarkable and he had like a degree from MIT , he had a degree , he 's working on his doctorate he might have completed by now
I Yeah so he is leaving Allegheny and he 's gon na go to be a Buddhist monk
That does n't surprise me he 's done research with   overlapping he has done something
I It 's crazy just like ok bye
One of his research projects is like community of monks somewhere it might have been south america I think it was I mean he like lived with them for six months that 's literally something I 've always thought of
We had a group of tibetan monks at clarion for
I Yeah they did one at Allegheny too
I That 's really cool
It was only like one credit but I just wanted to take
They actually take the sand and they have a ceremony where they like pour it into a river
Yeah so like what they do they destroy the whole thing after they made it and then they take it to a river and it does n't matter how much effort you put into something it still
I Yeah like permanence and yeah and detachment
I guess that there was some um monks that came up to allegheny they ` were up here for about a week but they did the same thing they like i saw people later and they were like look and they like and they had little vials of the sand
Did they give them or did they take them
I I think they were like giving them and I was like that 's cool but like does n't that defeat the point is n't it supposed to like you 're not supposed to keep it cuz like you 're yeah it 's supposed to but anyways
I um
That 's like a funeral with all the incense I mean we have celebrations of death just like we celebration of life
I So I 'm wondering what do you love about Meadville
I But it 's what that was what you felt from your perspective , that how you viewed it
I That 's great that 's really cool . What about you , what do you love about Meadville ?
I mean it 's not far , but like everyone was graduating now people were moving and I 'm here like I wanted to move here and wanted to move in with him and then there 's the whole thing in Meadville I 'm
I Yeah for sure
I He 's great , let me tell you
Well I thought that was kind of cool also understood I was like I know way more people than I thought I did like
I So I think I know what brought you to meadville , why do you stay here ?
I Would you agree Jack
But Voodoo has some bands that overlapping
I cool
I He 's the manager of northwest state , it 's over by the Marc
I No that 's valuable
I And that 's created by like one person , spearheaded by one person with help with a couple others that like want to do this he just started it .
I Jason Zackle , started the website
He 's been doing a lot of stuff you mentioned your son growing up in a place where there 's always something to do and he can have something to do .
In other words we ran into people we knew there was other people we did n't necessarily know " oh we 're getting through to the same person , you know drinking the same thing .
Oh I wanna get out of here and I 'm like coming from someone whose lived here less than two years . it 's muffled so the parks shut down and they were all just going to get together and set up a table

Well I think that the transit system is excellent . Now that I 'm a senior I have a free bus pass to the city bus and share a ride , for two dollars one way in Meadville and I have n't driven a car in eleven years .
And also , I really appreciate Chaps and Journey Center because they have made a quantum leap in my recovery of my mental illness . Before I came here my mental illness was very personal and after i came here
they said that 's really unusual to have such a good system you say you live in a rural area , and I 've been told by my mental health services that Meadville has the best services of um , a lot of places .
I lived in quality living center for a year and a half and when I needed their services they were excellent , very supportive they provided transportation so that I could come into town and take this dialectical behavior therapy classes , which lasted several months .
And I appreciate that sharing of communications and socialization .
Well my two of my classmates from second grade on live in Meadville , and we still get together ,
We 've been best friends over 60 years
At least once a week .
Mostly my mental health services .
My therapist .
Gave me an application for Park-Side Commons which he felt like I 'd be independent from quality living center . pause
Mm ... Second Saturday .
Well that 's a bunch of vendors at the Market House , but they also have entertainment and projects for children on the second Saturday . On the other Saturdays its vendors for produce . But on Second Saturday it 's more comprehensive to the community .
Yeah I think it 's like from eight to two and then they have Meadville Friday , which is for Friday evenings .
I do n't know I do n't go ...
I think there 's food and ...
pause Journey Center .
Because they 're a certified club house , indiscernible club house , which means we have an international networking ... and so we get impressions , and strengths and weakness from all over the United States . but I know that it 's an international organization .
In fact a similar reason I 'm not living in Southern California now .
Yeah it is .
I would say Second Saturdays and the , I ca n't remember the title of that program when they were having that series of presentations last summer but I think just , the college students , and their advocacies as a community .
Women 's services
Mental health in Meadville , um , there was one about um , violence .. about when you should call somebody , I ca n't remember the title of that presentation . pause
No it 's been a good year .
they are very purposeful and uh , and they um , have a lot of out reaches like taxes and the library does taxes too , and I 'm only about two blocks from the library
Yeah . pause
But if you , I 've lived in , I graduated nursing school in New York State , moved to Southern California ' 69 to ' 88 , worked in Ohio , New York , California , and Pennsylvania nursing
ight because they 've lived here all of their lives . pause
pause Well that they have ... through their presentations and seminars and services they provide they have uh , um , very extensive outreach to the community .

**excerpts:**
It 's kind of hard to digest those three parts because thinking about Meadville -- it 's home . So it 's just part of who I am now at this point .
And we all have families and it 's very easy to have a family here because of the resources that we value . We know our kids are safe with other agencies and other groups and sports and other groups that they 're associated with .
It 's a great region to be in . so if you 're into outdoor stuff there 's a lot of things all season to do . There 's ,
We have state of the art medical facilities , we have high end colleges and education , opportunities , ya know , we have all of those pieces available if you get connected and seek it out .
The science center , we went to the aquarium in Cleveland for an overnight during the summer and it was beautiful . We went there we saw it I 'm like I 'm alright .. I 'll go there No ) .
I feel safe there .
Yeah , ya know we 're like right in the center .
I honestly think they know , but they do n't think about it or , ya know , you hear people break about Meadville , ya know , there 's nothing to do .
Oh I have a carpet cleaning business .
Auto repair .
It 's interesting because it 's a lot of what I 'm doing , and in the early childhood realm is trying to connect parents to resources for parents to be their child 's first teacher .

MOPS -- Mothers of Preschools .
Yeah , just from being an information hub and distributor . Intercity transiency between 23 and 25 % move from year to year . So creating some sort of access points , a lot of it happens on Facebook , a lot of it happens online .

Without that relationship they 're not going to be as open or wanting to listen or even accept help because without that relationship there 's a divide and a separation .
, somebody else promised me something and did n't do anything . And that 's just completely destroys the relationship and the trust and the everything . So when we say something , we have to do something .
ight , because like ya know , they have so many people who let them down , who have walked out of their lives , who have promised them things and did n't do anything and just and they are so used to that .
So we have to be aware of what 's available in town , what going places1316(indecipherable ) will do and different schools . So I need to be able to have a relationship in every direction that maintaining the family that I 'm working with .
So it 's building trust with the families and the people we want to get the information , but it 's also that next layer of ( other   what do we do with it ?
We are helping people , but we all need to know about that Those are the things people remember and that safety feature involved with trustworthy people , especially with you 're not letting them down because they are let down a lot .
And like Jeremiah 's example the little boy needed the tire , that 's a single mom situation . I do n't know how many guys she may have dated that made those false promises to this little six year old .
Kids are a product of their environment . If they 're not shown that you 're gon na keep promises and do what you say you 're gon na do , it becomes a way of life and it 's a ripple effect . It continues with their kids .
And their trauma .
Otherwise they 're just dangling .
Sources of trauma , yeah .
Their guardian , whoever 's in charge ..
They 're in fight or flight mode all the time and they 're often angry . They think I 'm gon na come in there judgey because I 'm the church lady .
So it 's not their fault , it 's really not .
It 's not . It 's a lot of circumstances .
They have what looked like a pop-up activity , it was n't like a BBQ or fundraiser , it was something for the community That was like in June or something I saw that . They were trying something .
So there are catholics , or methodists , or unitarians in a central place with a central goal to pray for the city and how great it can be .
Have you done any since then ?
There 's pastor breakfast and there 's , coming up soon , is another gathering for the pastors .
Do they do the outreach once they eat dinner or approach the community or ?
That 's the goal . But I do n't know , I 'm not privy to that I 'm not the pastor .
So because you could do a quick neighborhood thing , you have trust with a lot of those neighborhoods So it has to be over here , that neighborhood , this neighborhood , where we 're sitting now .
They 're different areas and that 's their unit There are various agencies in Meadville which help families with different things that may arise in their family life . There are so many different agencies .
Crawford county coordinating because there 's the LICC , local inter - agency coordinating council . There 's so many acronyms you get lost in the jargin . and it 's just getting everyone together for the common good .
For me it 's kids . I 'd only been at my location for a few months now that 's where my business is . It 's not the kids ' fault they are where they are .
Hey if you remember this lesson , we 'll get you a candy bar next week if you remember that . '
They either did a really good job or they did a really bad job You see the kids walk by your shop . ( other   there 's not a lot of parents walking them by ) .
It 's probably more moms , it would just depend . Sometimes the men come over because there are toys that occupy the child . I think it would be more of a toss up , it would depend on the day and the place .
Thank you Kristin for speaking up for the male race .
There are plenty of involved dads in certain community settings , and the places we 're going have been since we 're still building trust have not been the places where you guys are doing sidewalk church .
So what brings him ( Jeremiah ) is he 's going to be the male that he craved seeing , whether he saw that or not , he 's going to make that available to the town because some kids do n't have that
And the father / male example in kids ' lives , the daughters , the young women . The males that they see in their lives are the model of the male of their future husband .
We hope to disrupt the bad behaviors and set the example off . Not all are bad . Hopeful to disrupt the bad and just be the example whether it needs to be modeled or not .
We have families in those communities that there 's a man , there 's a woman and they do a great -- there 's a family that helps us with sidewalk at the one site . So there are good families .
There are also amazing fathers out there .
I really wanna hear what Dan 's answer is . You started an issue here buddy .
go back out , I do n't know what it is really . But if you did , maybe you had no real reason to do it , you had your own reason .
I ve never had a problem , not one problem .
And you 're not gon na .
In that area , I 've never had anything messed with . I ve had kids come like see my mechanics pushing a car like a fourth grader will go behind the car and push it .
Yeah , that 's what 's really happening there . It 's not just dangerous zones .
Yeah , we have normal kids that I do n't know their names but every time they walk by I get a smile or a wave .
Where I work , where my business is .
I mean what drawn me , I think you guys are the voices . I 'm not . But i just think small business can contribute to , to make it better . Not commercially or anything like that , but to reach more people .
Yeah , whether it 's with taxes or doing a block party and getting that community togetherness .
So here are some books .
So if you take the ten minutes as a male who knows how to use these tools appropriately and read them this page of the book and teach you sockets . Or read this page of the book and teach you wrenches .
I guess sometimes I get tunnel vision .
ight , but your kids know how to use most of those tools appropriately , correct ?
Half of them .
Boys side or the girls side ?
Okay , but realistically the kids walking by your shop every day , I do n't know how many tools are in their houses or someone has sat them down to show even basic , this is a phillips head versus a flat head .
ight , when they have to change a tire .
You were taught , your dad taught you . And maybe that s the way to get a local place that happens to make wrenches and things Here , these are for the kids . You did n't know you were getting a new job tonight , did you ?
And that 's a trade around here that s vital to the community . That 's a good industry .
I 'm like ' oh my ... it 's over ' . But it was a real pain in the butt .
At the Vernon Place ? Was that the meeting ?
Oh the municipal church . I remember .
I must have been excited .
We were above the market house and i wanted to do the pop-up in my parking lot , but i wanted to do it at night because i wanted to do night time activities . so what , it was a beautiful , wicked fun time that night .
that was hours of free entertainment for every level of family , regardless .
Look at all the businesses that come together , it costs them money to participate . It 's shocking how many business will jump on board with a concert or a community event , or whatever .
It costs money to be in that event if you 're not a non - profit .
And to build the floats and the car .
And all the money raised to a local beneficiary . And that changes each year , the local beneficiary .
I think more businesses would be on board to contribute .
, it was like the definition of a pop-up . ' I do pop-up preschools . Autumn Vogel was there , and she did a pop-up art installation , we 're all doing these pop-up things . And it 's beautiful .
But like before that block party , I had never heard of the Going Places project . Maybe everyone 's coming to Dilman 's but then get the Going Places project and Living Waters out there too .
To couple them with things that people are already doing .
And get your services and whatnot , not promoted but pushed out there , so the public knows more about it .
And knows that you as a business owner , you were there sponsoring the event . And you were not looking for personal gain , you were looking for the event , but it still was there at your spot .
Even if it was raining this time , the rain did n't stop anything .
But what we could do as business people , we can do all of that , we are our own board from payroll to washing the toilet .
I was seeing people , I do n't know where I was just at .
We see families all over town , and kids will run up to us , especially if we 're wearing a designated shirt and they 're like ' Miss Jenn ! ' But we have kids like flock to us in Walmart , or the parade we were all watching and were like ' that 's my kid , that 's my kid ' , we were claiming hundreds of kids .
They do n't follow you , you follow them .
Literally we had a newborn baby born last week , three pounds , and one of the first text messages dad do you need transportation for medical appointments ? you have a brand new baby , are you prepared for this ? ' .
we are definitely the sighting , like people say to you like ' oh yeah you 're the Pumpkin Derby guy , you 're that guy ' .
And she was like ' I mean Jen from street church ' . I got a text message because everyone has my phone number for bus ministry , if they need their kids picked up
Yeah , that 's a small barrier in this town .
Oh , I think its nonexistent honestly .
I mean there could be , but its very narrow .
And I wanted the Chamber of Commerce to notice me , I wanted the bigger guys , like Acutec , to notice me because how easy these little people and you guys are doing nothing but charging for every damn golf tournament , and you ask me for something to give away . Anybody , Mike 's a few months in , but what a wonderful ' Hello , here I am ! ' for Mike . And I did n't realize you were moved in until Facebook . ' And all this was generated in a few days , whatever you wanna call it .
My boys the night before . They all did it and then they came on Saturday and they live in Titusville .

My program Going Places is a partnership between Meadville Children 's Center , Crawford Central School District , and Laurel Technical Institute . So Laurel Technical Institute has an early childhood education program . Those early childhood education program people who are going to get their CDA , they come and help us at our events and get field experience with our kids .
Twice a month somewhere , either there or there , twice a month , and then we get10002
And that 's the plan . So now that we 're recognized enough to go , to start going . Its breaking down those silos and putting down little tiny bridges in between . It 's starting to come together .
Some parents choose get on , they willingly get on a bus , and they ride a bus for an hour to go to a church service and they ride the bus home . So 60 wiggly kids on a school bus .

When I mail my bills , I walk them . I walk my bills . I go across the street and pay my water bill . and I pay a bill .
Well , I still go to local sporting events , ya know ? On the high school level . I 'm all for prorgress- downtown progress , community progress . ya know , new bridge , this , that- I 'm a Meadville man .
Uh , the people that come into my business , I know them on a personal basis . It 's just a quaint little community . I 've moved away before , but I always like to come back to Meadville .
My friends . I mean , my acquaintances . Let 's be clear . My acquaintances . Not so much my friends , but my acquaintances . The smallness of it , the camaraderie .
Same people that take tickets , same people that coach And it 's not on a real personal level but your'e acquainted with these people . I might go to Oil City or Franklin or Greenville and I know a lot of people there .
It 's .. I sometimes long for a city atmosphere . But once I 'm in the city for a while ... it 's just different . I lived in Miami for a while .. Ya know , everybody 's looking at their shoes .
I mean specifically ?
You mean downtown people ?
I 'm not crazy about parking tickets . Mainly the second floors .. see some development in second floor whatever . If you go downtown , you just see first floor . We 're second floor down here . We 're second and third floor .
It 's gotten better . I mean there 's some go-getters down there like Bill next door and some of these guys that are really good at developing ideas . I mean he took over the old post office , ya know ? He made that prosper .
The Mercatoris building , where 's that ?
Oh okay , where they used to have the self defense place downstairs ?
Oh yeah , that 's a beautiful building .
Oh you wo n't believe it when I showed at the end how big this is .. This is a big building . It 's got 11,000 square feet .
Well , it 's been a lot of work . You ca n't even imagine what we 've done in this place . Air condition , new lights , new track , clean . I mean , just developing floors , sanding , moving walls in and out .
And we do n't have to get wheelchair access because we 're grandfathered in . But we still have to pass fire codes . But as far as what you 're saying , a lot of , uh no . I 'm pretty much good with codes .
ya know , I was substitute school teaching and this kid kept saying to me we need another partner who0916(indecipherable ) . And then getting in it , and then it was terrible money , but it was a lot of satisfaction .
I like working ' . But I love to go to work , I love to see my friends , and I love to .. Boxing , like amateur boxing .
Women love it . Women love it because it 's hard work out and uh ..
Small town .
Not because we 're a college town . and ya know , he 's a big big football man , we argue every day . and he 's just a great person . The tv thing ? ' And he 's just a wonderful person .
Well , I 'm just being honest and I think every business person probably has their own little quirks . I mean if I was i would n't be in this business . But I 'm about excitement , I 'm about surviving .
I was all for it , I was for the expansion of North St. Ya know , you hear so much pessimism about downtown and smaller towns , but I would n't trade this little downtown for anything .
Yeah , and ya know I 'm the first one . If somebody comes back to Meadville that I 've known from before , they say ' this town looks terrible ' . I say ' on the contrary ,
Yeah , we got some decent restaurants , but most places do . But who has a state of the art movie theater like we do out there ? It 's got like ten theaters in it , and its just exciting , ya know ?
And the little one downtown is kinda hanging in there , and they 're making some moves to improve , ya know ? So , that 's all I can say .
So we 're done ?

**excerpts:**
It 's integration , I think its sort of very its size and scale allows for a huge kind of integration between folks in town , sort of a synergy that 's here .

and we were sort of able to share hearts and um and put our efforts back into real work right after the election , so that it was n't just all about despair ,
and I was looking right across at the Mind Body Wellness Center , which I spent the last 13 years of my career really doing work in Mindfulness and wellness , and I thought , this is a really good omen .
When I came , when I came , you know I could choose a number of really really ... you know I remember a comment that you said at one of the breakout workshops for not Cranberry park but
maybe there 's an opportunity to work with that young man or insights like that and somehow I said something about Joseph Campbell or something like that and suddenly we were off to the races and

is I think sometimes there 's - but I think we might tend to jump might back into our peer group or our protective group at times also and not feel willing to venture forth , and I worry about that sometimes .
there 's some between Meadville Crawford Central School and Allegheny and maybe some of the efforts going on in town , there 's some unwilling-unwillingness to give up a certain I hope that some of the other agencies in town are not set apart from that in a way - and sometimes I worry about how to keep connection with some of the social service agencies like AC and CHAPS-uh MMC , and

it is a great process - I 've lived in San Francisco , New York City , Boston , London , you know

**sum:**
**excerpts:**
I would say the people in it , a lot of people have friends and family in Meadville , so that distinguishes Meadville from any other place you go because you always have to come back to see your friends and see your family .
I like the shops . The shops are unique and it 's like a small town shop I like that about Meadville . I am not from here so , but it is real nice .
Um , I recently moved in September from Oil City and it is not that much of a difference other than that there are more options to eat and to do everything . But , they are both small towns so they are0240 .
I am seeing even more is community members coming together and creating these big events and things for families to do and that 's a big deal .
but , I work in Meadville So I was always around town and I love that the going places project was started because that brings the community together , work with their kids , and just make it better community as a whole .
So , sort of the small size and people coming out and doing things together , the connection between families , small shops , family continuity , people coming back , sort of small town consciousness like Oil City , something very familiar that you can come back to .
I was born and raised in Erie , and I moved to the Saegertown area and worked in Meadville for the last 6 - 7 years , and one of the things that really stands out to me is the road signs that are along ...
Just those , those events .

I am from not specifically Meadville , but from Conneaut Lake . But , I was in a youth group all year round in the summer we would always go to the parks in Meadville and have a picnic , play on the swings , and stuff .
I would say if you had it in Pittsburgh or Erie , it 's like more of a city setting , whereas Meadville is more of a small town , so everyone ...
homey ... even if you do n't know people they are kind enough to at least tell you hello and it has more of a comforting feeling then if you were to go to an event at Pittsburgh and have a whole crowd and do n't know anyone .
You could go to an event two nights in a row in Pittsburgh and see not even see the same people twice . and you could see the same people and you could talk about what happened last time and what 's happening now .
Not only that but I think we are supporting each other 's businesses and things to- often . Um , some of your local businesses are running different things and it pulls in more customer base for them as well .
You know going places is here , and then through those events I started hearing about Heart and Soul , and then I started about different things going on but I noticed groups are starting to talk now and the community is starting to talk now which is huge .
I think it is starting now , it is and I know sometimes you go to systems , you said Pittsburgh and they already have things set up , but to watch   the process of how that happens is pretty exciting .
I feel like it teaches them that no matter the difference of groups , of people , because Meadville is a very diverse area .
I feel that it provides , it is providing our kids with more positive experiences in their lifetimes like being out and with their parents and it 's getting the parents to recognize that we need to do more thing with our kids .

I feel like it takes a village to raise a child so they need people with good hearts in their life , and just always keep them on track and do good , a good influence so .
And you kind of share the raising of the children , the information and the wisdom raising children and sharing with the adults and kids obviously .
and you do n't pay attention to what 's good and what 's going on . and they are going to become good people , I can go back and overrule the bad memory with all the good ones I have from where I am .



and as you are hugging your kids and you are talking to them
It 's multilevel because the kids need support with their anxieties and all the way up the ladder from adolescence to adults . But the parents need support because they transfer it down and it is a closed loop and it cycles back and forth between parent and child .
Especially , if you are a single parent it is even harder . You are a single parent

But , I think we are on the right track with the Going Places and all the different events going around town .
I know some parents have asked for particularly adolescent development groups or psychological groups , what is depression , what is cutting , or things that specifically need to be addressed .
I feel like parents do n't take as much advice as childcare as they do , because in high school I did a job thing for head start but like that 's a resource that we have

**sum:**
**excerpts:**
Merry Lee Melis . the different activities were available for families . We used to come down to the Halloween Parade and park their by the Academy Theater and then climb up on top of the car so we could see and we would hangout and watch the parade when we were younger . But , the Academy Theater always had movies and there was a group that moved up to the Odd Fellows building that did plays in the community theater .
I am Joyce Aredneck and I am not form here but I have lived in the area for a little more that 20 years almost a little over 21 years Different activities like Marry eluded too .
These are rural Appalachian town Meadville and Gadez , typically of borderline Midwestern communities . They were muddy make shift foot hill cities at the turn of the century , dewy in the spring , snowy in the winter , and muggy hot in the summer .
And , this book has not been circulated , well it circulated six years ago . and he spent his younger years here Especially about being here , I cam here 25 , what 26 years ago
Well , I lived my whole life in Erie , I went to school in Erie , well I was born in Cleveland but I spent most of my elementary and college career in Erie . but I was working at the Erie library and
My husbands job brought me to the area , we live by Cambridge Springs , then I saw the add in the paper and that 's why I came to Meadville I applied for the job .
He ran the tape through the machine that took the coils and made the teeth for the zipper , and I could to go on take your kid to work day one day , and I got to see the machine that he ran .
I am Cindy Aims , I grew up here , I went to Sagertown . I only lived 5 or 6 miles out of town so I was always coming here and I just decided to stick around , creature of habit .
And , you would be surprised how many people come up to me and say are n't you that guy from the library , I like the level that I can go out and people know me , so ?

you had the Talloon plant , they made artificial fibers at the viscos plant , and so on and so on there was the TNT , where they stored the TNT not to far from here down by Atlanta
We always called that the TNT because my mom lived in one of those 0909 after the war . And , there was a lot of farming in this area a lot of different   groups of people with the Mennonites and the Amish and we have one of the larger African American communities in Crawford County in town . So , we have some variety too
did n't think twice about it and then he heard the radio broadcast from the Ortion Mercury theater here .
So , my Aunt was a teacher in one of the local schools , like I said their were jobs for a long time here so people did not really need to go hunting around for jobs .
Probably , because he helped found one of the local volunteer fire departments , so he volunteered that way . He did not belong to any social clubs but there have been a lot of them who have been in town in Lions and the Elks and what not .
Ya , the Italian civic center and all those different clubs that people could belong to if they wanted to there 's lots of different kinds of churches in the area . So , when my brother wanted to go to the Baptist Church there was one for him , they were Presbyterians . They took us to the Baptist Church if that was were we wanted to go because there were choices .
It does n't take too long to drive out of town and within a few miles you can be in the woods and and I had like 20 different bird varieties outside my house .
It 's something I really like since I was a kid we always went camping ...
Not really we were on route 98 so it did n't feel like we were in nature , but we went camping a lot . And , I always spent a lot of times in the woods . Just wandering around1224 .
and it kind of nice . so I do n't miss any of that . But , I like being close to nature too I take my grandkids there to do that now .
Big yard ! And there are trees time , and a swamp to go swamping in . All that start of stuff , and a fire haul to wake you up , it 's very exciting !
You know I am going to Chicago this weekend and maybe I will walk around with a sign on my chest that says that I have a backyard .
The Market House .
Just because it feels like a central hub for activity and there 's vendors and Second Saturday , there is always something going on down there .
We used to have a drum circle and there were a couple times where we did drumming along with Couty Harris 's Tai-chi group and that was a lot of fun .
I think I would say the fairgrounds , the Crawford County Fair Grounds because not only is the fair the big thing up there but there are lots of other things that go there or come into town .
and he had all of these cowboy hats , and he asked us or name and we were talking to him and he 's working with a bottle of glue writing our names on these cowboy hats and then putting glitter on it , and
it 's like you leave on the last Saturday in September and then last Saturday in August and it 's like the same thing , it does n't change , everything is always in the same spot . All the vendors are in the same spot .
ight , haha .
it 's just . and we had the Pancake Palace up there for many years , and we actually spent , we would start getting it ready in June and we would be up there you know two nights a week from June all the way to September .
We used to go to Conneaut Lake park all the time
That 's the thing with this town is that everybody talks about cuts and cutting back and doing more with less I am . We did n't cut things and cut and cut and cut . I think if we do that we will be much better off .
There is less community involvement then there was in my youth . Fewer people volunteering , fewer people stepping up and taking leadership positions , and I 'm not sure people would n't still do that or nobody 's approached them in the right way or ...
Every business that did business in this town belonged to a service club or something , and that was payed by the businesses . And have the records show that John Bryce is a graduate from Gannon University in the class of accounting .
I know we have the Make A Difference Day
If you could see ya I worked on that , I helped clean up the Diamond Park after a storm . And , they worked all day on it and that ramp is still there
Well , I am not talking investing money , I am talking investing time , something that gives you pride afterwards but something that kinds of have a lasting impact .
but it was also bring people together . You would meet no people and ...
We have a wonderful college up on the hill , one of the best for year tradition colleges in the United States , but none of those people stay here . We invest all this time and effort for them to come to this community and then they all leave as soon as they graduate , and the reason they leave is because we do n't have the high tech industries here that this economy requires so there really needs to be an incubator or some type of a place where local industry can work with the Allegheny College students and I think we would get a lot of synergies off that .
and if I had been encouraged to explore various trade school kind of things , I might have chosen an entirely different route . I get to tinker with things all day , but ...
Well , like schools working with businesses to do mentoring and to give kids opportunities to go out into various businesses and industries and see what working in those industries is like ...
Ya I had one of my patrons just a couple weeks ago , you know that kind of thing . And , I know my soon is getting out of service in a year , he is in computers also .
And you look at Meadville and it is completely a 180 different degree , everything is growing down there , there is bustle . but the community is not all that much bigger than this community . and you can just feel it there is an energy there .
And so , we have to be able to retain our local capital , local3014 , our local people and You really ca n't recruit people to come in here , so you have to make the investment in our young people .
He might , he has been living in a warm climate for 9 years , Las Vegas and now San Antonio for his whole career and he said he wants a change of season . and he is in computer security in the Air Force.3117
And he is head of the computer security where he is at right now , so there is nothing that is going to pay him or be comparable around here .

# Copy of Unitarian story circle LS_2_17 Transcribed.docx
**sum:**
**excerpts:**
that I thought it was an attractive town .
I love the Market house on a Saturday morning , after I take some junk there , some recycling cans from my house to the recycling center into the junkyard sometimes I stop by there sometimes I buy something .
And I think I like that there is space to be used in Meadville that is not used .
The Commons-yeah , common spots why is n't it filled - Someone said yesterday that they 'd like to sit in that common spot that they do n't know where to find in Meadville . but how nice it would be to be in one spot

that all did very well in college and had a good academic base , and I also love my church because there is not another Unitarian Church like this with this sort of historic background going back to the holder of the Dutch land grant here , and there was actually a theological school here until may 70 years ago that had maybe 100 years in existence that is now part of the University of Chicago - the Meadville Lumbar Theology School .   and there 's a lot of sort of surface interaction , and
and I really wanted to get him a home town - so I knew that it was kind of in the middle , but it was also a good town for music and art cuz I 'd been coming to this town by chance - and I 'd even come to this church for Cuzzies Jazz Jam 's - I 'd tie in a trip here coming home from visiting my mom 's house
Um , so I came to Meadville because I go to Allegheny , but Meadville and being involved with people in Meadville is what made me stay that 's why I stayed .
It used to be too large and industrial , Talon Zipper had its origins here and had two or three different locations and Avtecs also went back a number of decades making man made fibers , and when those left , I think there was sort of a feeling , of boy so I expect the hospital is gon na remain viable for a long time .
Well I think we are actually stuck just like everybody else in places with half democrats and half republicans , I think the spirit is kind of bruised here like everywhere -
The Martin Luther King Dinner tomorrow is very a very integrated and wonderful celebration also the Northwest band that comes here and performs in the gazebo - that was given by a man who had a piano shop here , Buellen , and he specified in his will that the plans that he had laid out were not to be changed - that the town either took it or left it behind
but that 's one positive place that people seem to come from all over and sit in the same park together and listen to music
I think on all different ends of political spectrums you 've got people here who see Meadville as something big , People have big dreams for Meadville and um , and see it , and see it as as I do n't know ,
and um the great lakes are bring protected and the French Creek system , there is more and more land being acquired by trust or gift so that the uniqueness and the purity of that water system is a source of pride to the people here .

- we 're a county seat , we 've got the courthouse and this new annex to the Courthouse and that 's a a big part of our skeleton , and I 'm not so sure that I like that .
that 's a large part of why I decided that I did n't want to move , you know I 've been to a number of different UU Churches across the country whenever I 'd visit or for special convocations and I have n't found a church that is nearly as meaningful to me-now everybody might think that -but for me I could n't find anything worthwhile to move affiliated with the Church , I would really miss this place .

, we were one of , I do n't know if we were the first area to desegregate schools , but it happened early on when a petition was presented to Judge Church because he wanted his kids to go the school nearest his home and Judge Church
The Market house on a Saturday morning in the summer - if that were taken away it would n't be Meadville anymore for me .

I do know when the KKK decided to come here three or four decades ago and they wanted to stand on the Courthouse steps , and that was permissable freedom of speech , but I do know of the alternative of the community event and that was for everyone in the community to come down to the bicentennial cabin for a picnic - and uh , there was n't a whole lot of attendance at the KKK meeting .
So what 's the ideas behind them that you would like to see continue into the future .
but I know that there are probably a lot of efforts probably through students ' initiation to maintain ecological and energy saving initiatives , uh , inclusion of all students and the right to freely represent-uh-to feel safe on campus no matter who you are .
The theaters-movie theater and playhouses

I like the size of the town , you can get anywhere in 5 minutes .
and there 's and I just always have been a part of the Meadville where that is , because I have been here a short time , and

and then there was this just this kind of huge void and downtown was dead but I think its people are um excited about that , there are some great local businesses around here and a good focus on that right now .
Well , speaking of tax base , like you know that one building on the corner of park and Arch , the taxes were like nearly $ 4500 per year which you know is nearly $ 500 dollars a month .
ight and its just gon na , you know it takes more than a vested interest in downtown to make a business work

ight , I understand that .

any time I was n't at home or at work and even some of my work time I was just there
I would turn the gas station on Park Avenue into a Youth Center
Um that 's not their own home ,

Mine would be to take this division that 's everywhere and soften it .
and um this is working different places

# Grow Meadville + Pat 7_25.docx
**sum:**
**excerpts:**
The community .
and I lived in Providence , hode Island for 18 years and Albany , New York for 7 years
A little bit of both . the other thing is that both places I was working on college campuses I worked for technical institute and then Brown University . And those are transient neighborhoods so it could be partially that that there was n't that sense of community .
Well thank you , I 'm glad to be back . It 's been 11 years and I do n't regret it .
What matters most ? Affordability
Some things are cheaper some things are more expensive . Over all it 's cheaper here .
But then you know then also after I graduated from Penn State I came back and I worked as a newspaper reporter for 5 years with the Meadville Tribune And then after I moved back from New England I worked at Allegheny for uhhh 3 years
Yes I did . I really enjoyed writing the newspaper . Its just , there was no money in it . I could hardly support myself .
She got me into a summer creative writing program that was being run by two Allegheny students who were working on their masters in teachers , Allegheny still offered their masters in teaching at that point .
ah ha
Uh what brought me back was family . Yeah .
I never married and I never had children . And I have my sister sarah and her daughter and I 've spent a lot of time with those , her grand children , my sister 's grand children .
and I was able to find a job doing something I wanted to do .
P Well at Allegheny . But what keeps me what would make it better now ? I mean I like it I do n't feel like anything is missing .
Uhh Crawford County fair the county fair the uhh balloon festival , programs like this ( Grow Meadville ) , uhhmm second saturday you know and there 's a lot of irony that a lot of these programs came out of community service projects from Allegheny .
Probably the balloon festival .
Well plus it does n't cost anybody anything and you know it 's easy to get to it 's free it 's you do n't even have to go you can just look up .
Families out there the mother packed the picnic lunch or the father brought something for dinner and
We grew up within a couple blocks of the Allegheny College field and in the winter we would walk over . I was maybe 10 years old , which was really early back then .
Mmhmm and my cousins
My family and friends ... obviously . But what thing about Meadville .... Well I think the College is a tremendous asset . Umm most people do n't realize it but Meadville 's never thought of itself as a college town , not like State College or even Edinboro ...
but there 's always been a very strong hold of family-owned businesses like Channellock , Ainsworth , Greenleaf But ummm ... and they 've made a lot of very valiant efforts to become more a part of the comunity ` and that kind of thing
Yeah . I do n't know that they need to be equal but I think that they need to be aware that they 're codependent .
and I told him that I thought it was important for the College president to remember that Meadville does not consider itself a college town . It considers itself that hosts a college .
When I was in high school , we had student teachers that were from the Allegheny Masters in Arts program and that whole thing when PPMMMFFF .
There 's days I wake up and watch the Today Show and think about what stupid thing Donald Trump did or what idiot North Korea 's doing or how China is like growing so fast it does n't seem to be able to control itself . and I think you know what , I have to go over to Giant Eagle today and I 've got an interview at the MAC
Mmmhmmm it was even harder working in a dormatory and all the kids getting up to go to class and realizing you know that their father or their mother or their boyfriend or their girlfriend or old roommate had been in the towers at the time . That was ...
And to see all those kids wondering what their future was gon na be all about .
But my sister 's grandchildren are the ones that I was talking about and I like the fact that they go to a small school , that I know their teachers , that their father coaches their hockey team . That everybody is ....
Oh yeah . And I ... I do n't want you to use the term " help out " because I feel privilelged to be included . It 's not like
I know what you mean . Yeah , I know what you mean . Yeah .
Yeah . Do you know what it 's like when they fight over who gets to sleep with you that night ? You know ( laughter )
( Laughing ) It 's like , oh okay you can fight over me ! ( laugh )
we 're in fourth and fifth generations of welfare famillies that have been in child welfare services , family court ... for a town that 's so small , we have unbelievable poverty , child abuse , illnesses ...
Well obviously politics but then also serving on community boards and being active

You know I try to do stuff like little stuff on a day to day basis .
Yeah and I ’ve been doing that . But one of the things I need all the time are those plastic grocery bags because that 's what we put the stuff in they rarely come back
ight but most people if you ask them “ would you save your garbage bags for me ? ” oh sure I never know what to do with those things . And that 's something that i 've had the kids help me do .
So that they know what i 'm ’ doing and the little things they can do to support it . but you can help me collect garbage bags .
Very hard . sometimes people forget that
, you know what i mean its like lets quit putting bandaids on the problems and let 's work together to find out what 's causing the problems and what preventative measures could we put into place to keep them from developing further .
You know um you can go to kentucky fried chicken and you can buy a whole chicken meal for like 10 dollars . Well you can go to Tops and you can buy a rotisserie chicken or a whole chicken to cook in the oven for less than half that
What one thing ?
And teach them how to use that food , to make something healthy to give them the sense that they have something at stake here so that they would be willing to maybe cut open a fruit salad than open a thing of potato chips .
Well he loves wasabi . So i found that if i take fresh peas put them in the food processor , put in a little lemon juice , a little wasabi , he ’ll eat that up like , and he does n't think of it as healthy food
Yeah i got my niece one time to make an owl with me out of strawberries , pineapples , grapes .
And i 'm sure you 've become much more aware of what nutrients plants need , what nutrients plant provide you , you become much more of a chain ,   than just this random … yeah
Yeah , right and plus you have the feeling like you did something good for yourself . Yeah yeah
Change the flavor , change the texture .
Plus in terms of pride , this is yours .

Mhmm and that would be a lot more effective if i knew i 'm gon na donate 35 dollars and renee smith and her children from conneautville are gon na garden that plot for me
I would try to get teens and make it a project and get a sense of belonging and competition , like at gardens clubs and local gyms .
If you put someone in a dump , they do n't care , and it will become their dump within a matter of hours . So that it 's a matter of trying to encourage people to realize .
I would start by taking him to miller 's food factory or whatever and having him look at different plants . He actually is getting more into different plants but i 've done it from the approach of “
This is a kid that when he goes out to dinner he has ahi tuna and chicken fingers . it 's just a matter of cmon lets go and do this and i want you to do this .
His sister got really into cooking and that 's how she , and my sister used to say to her um go out in the garden and cut some basil and bring it in What was in her food
No because i do n't know how to do that , but with his grandmother yeah .
Well he 's here almost everyday anyway . I ’ll ask him about it . If he knows , and of course the best way is to get your buddy … your buddy gets interested in something , you ’re interested in it .
Would you be here without her ?
Oh well that s not a good example

In crawford county , not Meadville .
Specifically Meadville ?
I guess there was a lot more downtown stores . We had sidewalk sales , you know I remember that from my childhood . Coming to sidewalk sales , and walking up and down chestnut street . But , I do n’t know .
Well ,   one of my customers moved to Alaska and then when he visits Meadville he buys flowers .
There are a lot of good customers .
Oh ya , I think a lot of people come to the Market House to socialize , go eat , and visit . It is a destination where people meet . They ’ll say let ’s meet at the Market House .
No , I it is one of those things where I am still learning . There is always questions , somebody always has a question . and he knew if somebody had a question he would refer to it . But , he sold hers and other things too .

**excerpts:**
MY relationship began when I was a Bonner working at women ’s services . It made me get to know the area because … talking with people who were living there all their lives . Staying over the summer and get to do fun things .
Staying in Meadville has helped me in seeing the value of staying in a small town . But seeing the value of growing your experience over a long time , you can get so much out of it .
If this is where your heart is but your brain tells you to be somewhere else , I would listen to your heart because there ’s so much that you ca n’t see until you ’re in it .
FS EVSC classes took her downtown . I stayed over the summer and that was an awesome time . The best kept secret about Meadville is that the summers are wonderful .
When the year ended , I was like , “ and I wanted to be in a place where there were people that I loved . Meadville was the last place I ’d been really happy . I am going to fix things ! ”
The world is going to tell you you ’re They make you feel like you have to go do something But there ’s a lot of value in staying in a place that you have an understanding of or you want to deepen your understanding of .
The summers were definitely the thing that solidified the relationship , beyond service , attending events with community members . Ian Colley took his residents downtown . There are so many wonderful things to do here if you look for them and if you have people to connect you .
As a student , I was n’t constantly thinking about Meadville every day . I did service Saturday ’s and make a difference day , but , other than a church downtown , I did n’t get involved in any organizations downtown .
I would engage in safe spaces for Allegheny students like the market house . It felt like a nice half step into the adult world rather than moving everything and changing everything .
I chose to stay during the summer I was here and that ’s when I fell in love with Meadville . I decided that I would stay here for a year or two as a transition time . It ’s going to be hard to make that transition .
It ’s such a small town that anyone can do anything . You can do anything you want in this town because there are so few people here . If you want to become mayor … it ’s not that hard .
“ As a student , I was n’t thinking about Meadville every day . Taylor Hinton ’ 14 , now employed by the Community Wellness Initiative , expressed “ I stayed over the summer and that was an awesome time . The best kept secret about Meadville is that the summers are wonderful ! ”
It felt like a nice half step into the adult world rather than moving everything and changing everything , ” said Zach Cramer ’ 15 , the current AmeriCorps VISTA at the United Way of Crawford County .
They make you feel like you have to go do something Usually success is labeled to a big city and jumping in to something new and succeeding immediately or dealing with that struggle that you ’re expected to have .
n’t know ( Lexington , VA ) and I do n’t want to do that ever again . I need to be surrounded by excitement and adventures and new things , yes , but it ’s also about the people and having a connection to place .

# James and Christina Magee Interview.docx
**sum:**
**excerpts:**
Hello , my name 's James Magee .
And I 'm Christina Magee .
Uh , I 'm Emma .
Okay , do you want to start ? Where ever you 'd like
I am .
I 'm from Adamsville .
It 's out towards Greenville .
It 's closer to the Ohio border .
Still fairly local .
Well in that case , what brought you to Meadville or like why do you stay here ?
I stayed for family .
Um well , in Adamsville there 's nothing , uh I think that we had a post office and it burnt down .
Um well it is family oriented . I know that I like that it 's the trees , the rural kind of setting even in the city , um it still has kind of a rural feel to it because of all the greenery and stuff .
[ mutterings ] Oh yeah this one , in that case , um what were your experiences , whether where you were living before or here , what have been your experiences and interactions with technology growing up ? How did you get into your kind of field ...
Well , we 'll start with yours since yours is shorter than mine .
but I saw the advantages that it did give people . Uh , but it was , there was a clear advantage that the people that had this technology readily available , have had over the people who did n't
Are you done ?
Yeah , you can tell them ...
Alright , I know I grew up with technology , I mean at three years old , uh technically I got my associates in networking administration and security but uh , I just like fixing stuff for the most part .
Yeah , could you tell us a little bit more about about um , Techbox and what it 's like working there ?
Uh , I love working there , it 's , I 've learned a lot actually in the aspect of repairing cell phones and tablets . I found out it 's a lot easier than I thought it would be um ... I 've got an angry baby .
It 's alright [ chuckles ] , James Jr.
That is totally alright . And actually , I was gon na say we could take this opportunity , we can jump back to Techbox , but you were ...
Um well , technology in general is everywhere . Um so like we interact with technology everyday whether or not we 're realizing it Uh , because though technology has advanced greatly over the years , our interior has been left in the sixties .
No that 's perfect , yeah there is no exact answer .
Uh well , personally , first it was personal gain . I saw the technology as a way to improve my life and my family 's life .
Um , the way that we are trying to overcome this barrier is crowdsourcing , getting people to work together uh , obviously there are other financial options that have been presented to us , but uh , we 've declined borrowing money for any reason from anyone
I like to say it 's against his religion to borrow money .
Yeah , I do n't borrow money from people . then it just does n't get done . But uh , when you get into the banking systems , you get like that , you actually have other people who basically own
" I can afford five dollars but the sooner the better . Um , but yeah , technology is how we 're actually doing it , the internet , Facebook , social media , uh we built a website and ...
And have you seen a lot of activity on the website ? Have people had good access to it ?
Um , there have been a few people who have gotten involved , um unlike the crowdsourcing fund I 've noticed that locally we get a much larger number of investors but they are much smaller investments .
I know your one friend invested a couple days in a row .
Yeah . Yeah but he travels around the country so I do n't , he wo n't be back for a while , I do n't know .
Um , about two and a half grand . Which you know it 's not a lot but it 's more than I would have been able to raise by myself in a year .
A little less than a year .
Little less than a year , August will make it a year .
I thought it was actually more toward the end of August .
Ah , well technically the paperwork was dated for the 1st .
Alright , okay ...
Though it took us till the end of the month to get started , [ chuckle ] the paperwork was started on the 1st .
What would you say your goal with Increased Economic Opportunities is ? Whether social goals or ...
Um well , if I was going to describe that to you , Increased Economic Opportunities does a number of things . We improve the economy , the environment , and national security while reducing inequity .
But that is in short our goal .
No that 'd be great , if you 'd like to elaborate on those .
The more energy we produce domestically the less we have to by from foreign countries , Canada , Saudi Arabia , who ever else , um which provides us more economic stability in the country .
But I would see pretty much every south facing roof would have solar panels , every peak would have windmills , we would be exporting energy so we would have more money for local projects , uh anything from youth education and to elder benefits of different sorts .
and stuff and every house has solar panels for the business and just like the entire city is like , it 's just all tied in and flourishing .
I was wondering if you would mind , uh , if this is a good time to go back to the Techbox a little bit cause you were starting to just talk about the experience of fixing them saying that it 's a lot simpler than you thought
Uh , I know we have a lot of older clients , um they do , it actually surprises me how many older people actually do well with working , like doing their stuff on computers , figuring out their online banking , at least checking their email , and
Oh , you 're fine ... yeah no worries .
But no , it 's actually very rewarding , um , to help people , to teach people about how to use their technology , to fix stuff for them . Uh , I mean I went to LTI and they taught us
No it 's fine , that 's great . That 's mostly , most ones ... but um , I do n't know , is there anything in particular too , this is your chance to bring up , if there us anything particular
Um , I know that there are lot 's of programs that are underway . I 'm sure that you guys are aware of the majority of them than I am so ...
Not necessarily ,   [ chuckle ] but yeah
Well most of my information comes from Facebook , so and um the Meadville calendar .
Oh and Julie and Autumn , uh , Jason Sach .
Uh yeah , but they share their stuff on the Meadville calendar and uh , through facebook so , uh [ chuckle].
It makes me really happy to see people trying to do stuff for their community , like Dan Hunter , Lee and Autumn , like it 's amazing cause ...
There are lot 's of people who are unaware that these things are even happening , as much as people are trying to promote them and raise awareness .
Yeah , it 's really sad , there 's a lot of people that ca n't see the good in Meadville or the good that people are trying to do and they , they 're just so negative about it .

Oh that 's great , yeah
It 's a potluck picnic , everybody 's just supposed to go and hang out . We should have bocce and frisbees and I do n't know if anything else , I 'll have chicken [ chuckles ]
100 to 400 but I figure if you guys , you know everybody 's welcome
Bicentennial Park
Oh cool
Well close ...
Over by Meedock [ spelling ? ] across the street from Lincoln ecycling .
Yeah , I did n't realize , I 've actually , I 've met people who have never been there and I think it 's
Yeah , it 's like right over by French Creek , they 've actually got a little boat launch there and everything .
Yeah , cute little cabins where the restrooms are .
Yeah , we try to do most of our things , like anything public we do in a public place so anybody who wants to come can , we want to do more public meeting but it 's hard to , uh , get everybody to show up .
I feel like a lot of people forgot about the park because the bridge was closed for so long .
Mm hm , I have n't been there , someone was just mentioning it to me the other day , yeah .
But yeah , um so that 's about it . I know if you guys have any interest in helping IEO , I 'm always looking for people .
Oh cool , what kind of opportunities are there to help out ?
We gave ourselves a ten year start-up window , uh because it 's not , we looked at the math on it Uh , we 're not going to get 300 million dollars in a couple months or a couple years . [ chuckles ]
Or even just telling people about it .
, it 's that simple . Twenty years at like ninety five percent efficiency , factory warrantied , so like , and even after that it decreases they 're well past their prime and then they can be recycled . Um but yeah ,
That 's wonderful , that was actually one of my questions too , was if you 'd be alright with us contacting you at any point with other additional questions or possibly a follow up ...
as crowd sourcing effort , I have to be as open and as fluent with talking to people as I can be because uh , like I , it 's early on I mean , Bill Gates might be able to [ Emma chuckles ] but why would he ?
Well , why did he vaccinate an entire country against polio ?
Well cause he 's a nice guy . When you 're talking about investing 300 million dollars to invest into one small town to help 80 thousand people , they 're like " ehhh " .
it 's a lot farther down the line , but thinking long term could you see um , your business and project efforts here as being a possible model for other , either small communities or ... ?
Um that 's actually , especially [ The contest ] for you guys and the contest , we have to prove scalability . [ and replicability ] Uh , I mean you 're from Slippery ock , which I do n't believe is in Crawford County , is it ?
No uh ...
Butler County ? Uh well , we have n't expanded our service area as of yet With the grant competition we have an opportunity to get national and international recognition as far as like news stations and , it would be , I 'm sure it would get us a lot of funding if we were just on the BBC for five minutes . I mean we hit the Meadville Tribune and we got several hundred dollars the next day The Meadville Tribune did their article , we got people from Texas calling us because they saw it .
There 's all those people that like to interview you on Facebook too and stuff .
Yeah , we 've done Facebook interviews and things like that . We 've got a little bit of success there but I think that the online platform has a lot of trust issues because so many people have abused it .
Like that Nigerian prince that wants to send you money , you know
You know and I believe that that has made the ability to used the online crowd sourcing a little bit more difficult but it is still viable , uh , once you can prove that you mean what you said .
Like I had talked to some people who have worked at the Arc There 's also all of the local museums and random things that I have n't talked to anybody from Um people use the technology of some sort Uh and people , most people are like
I do n't know if there are any other questions but I think that was a great place to , that was a wonderful wrap up actually .
I think we actually covered absolutely everything I could think of at the moment . like I said if you are willing to have me or Joe contact you through Facebook or something with follow up questions
Oh yeah , [ No problem ] I 'm happy to share .
No , this was really wonderful , thank you so much .

# Jordan Marker- My Meadville Interview.docx
**sum:**
**excerpts:**
I love the restaurants in the area . and I like all these different kinds of restaurants .
Like the variety of food at my restaurant [ Cannon ’s Chophouse]. There ’s sandwich shops , there ’s all these little eateries and diners and stuff that are pretty cool
Favorite place to eat would probably .. taco bell laughs that ’s just realistic
I do n’t know . I like the community , like all the people that I see and meet everyday
That ’s pretty much mostly where you can find me .
Mmm I do n’t know . Maybe partying with all the college kids , that one night that I did .. Probably just walking down the street everyday making friends . That ’s what I like .
My job and not much keeping me here honestly . I just like the friends I made here
Like , a homeless program where we did n’t have to worry about shelter or like when our next meal was .. Something to help out the homeless because cops and everyone else in the area is just bullies to us
Like they literally come into the woods after us and tell us to pretty much drop everything we ’re doing and get out , with no place to go to to begin with . n’t know people in the community .
Good looks . I do n’t really know how else to answer ..
The night life is just .. If you walk down Main St at about 11 o'clock to 2 am you ’ll know exactly what i ’m talking about
ehh its like all the trouble makers came out and they …
Scout ’s honor .
It ’s hard to hang out with people when you 're only on a 3rd shift basis . Everybody 's asleep and like 1 of 5 people that ’s actually awake in town . They need more things for people to do on a 3rd shift basis .
Like jobs , like more jobs . Because everywhere is closed in the morning . As a cook , I ca n’t work first shift , because i ’m working second shift , I ca n't just work all day and then ..
I would like to see like , I do n't know maybe like an arcade or something
like , half a restaurant . Kind of like a Chuck E Cheese but like a lounge .
Cause that 's what I end up doing most of the time .
Like boys and girls clubs- have you ever been to one of those ? Like , back in the day that was awesome .
hell yeah
yeah other people could come too but i 'm sure it would be like for twenty somethings at like 3 am . Just like have a place for people to go to escape their lives for a while . Have it be part coffee shop or something
I mean , a restaurant .
Nah … I do n’t think so .
laughs sounds like fun
yeah , that would be cool
Maybe . If I worked there , yeah .
This warm weather
No , I stayed outside of Meadville , I worked in Meadville but stayed outside until like March and then moved into town
Luck that I ended up here in the first place
The leaves .
I do n't like the winter time because the trees look like death and are creepy . It ’s weird .
I guess , maybe .. I do n't know how to answer that one .
Investing in the youth
In a town like this , the kids are gon na end up with everything eventually anyway , so probably like better schools and programs for people to get .. out and away from the whole criminal element
Just have lots of programs and counselors that actually like counsel
one of the problems are the people that just do their jobs for the money to collect a paycheck but these kids barely get by . Kinda like how .. ( inaudible .. darn ! )
It matters to everybody . I mean , one day i 'm not going to be around and my kids will have everything . and they ’re going to have to deal with their own problems eventually
Yeah , they should n't have to worry about like , kids fighting and .. I ’ve seen a lot of that lately .
Anywhere from 15 to like 40
I do n't know , it ’s just so available , it ’s ridiculous Hell , you go to the bathroom on Chestnut and there 's people peddling it in the bathrooms
Does n’t matter , there are enough of them .
Like , just a place where you can go sit and watch tv , get out of school , do some homework , just being in your own bubble for awhile and meet up with other people that are doing the same thing
It would be nice
oh yeah ! Have like computers where you can go study or learn about all your programs
But you do n't , you would n’t need that because technology ..
I do n't want my kids to have to be scared every time they go out because people are whiling out and acting a fool or fighting in the park because they are twenty somethings that do n't know how to grow up
I would .. I do n't know . GPS on their phones , I guess .
I do n't know , get a red alert button they could press if they 're in trouble
any of the above ? I mean if somebody was attacking my little girl the fire department could show up with their axes and spray them down with the water hose
Job opportunities
Not exactly , just more stuff for people to do , ways to earn money without having to do so much at the same time .
I want cheaper apartments so that people can have one job and be able to stay in them
A waterpark !
Because who would n't want to go out and go on a bunch of waterslides and have all these little kiosks where you would like earn all of these trinkets . I just think that would be cool
I just imagine a water park around here
Better sidewalks
To get around , because i 'm almost constantly falling into traffic
Better , smoother sidewalks
Mmm .. that 's about it , community outreach programs I mentioned .

elease Yes
Its a place where you can get help for mental illness . And they also give you shelter if you need it . Um , I think that 's about it .
No , just since two days before Christmas .
The help-mmm , The people , they 're nice . Um ,
CVS , Walgreens , uh , the Mall-and uh , the EAD program
I want to go there , yeah-its a good program and I wanna read better , do math better-do social studies and science better .
It 'll help me pass exams , like the SATs and the exam to get in to college . I am thinking about going for CNA to help me and to help
Um , well , I saved two people in my lifetime and I liked doing it
Well , my sister was with this guy and a car fell on top of him
They help you to learn how to live independently
The help .
Learning to live independently
uh , the confusion of walking around , giggles
Having somebody who can walk around with me
Everything being on the same block and easier to get around
um , I made some good friends here - yeah ,
um , no that 's it .

**sum:**
**excerpts:**
I sense that there is a good community of agencies that help other people in every aspect of life - and I think Meadville is a nice size town for family oriented kind of things - not too big or too spread apart everything is right here together .
I guess the sense of unity in the community
uh , like agencies and events are coordinating together and working together to provide I guess a nice set of activities - they 're courteous to each other
uh , I did n't actually grow up in Meadville , but my children did , and they made good friends here
mmhmm - and love the hot air balloons
um employment brought my husband and I here and we just lived here for a long time , so its home .
The Market House is one thing that really values what the town meant and how it is now .
Well , so they have a variety of activities there as well as events and community gatherings
Um , a lot of the history - like the zipper was invented here , and how its recognized with beauty with the gardens and stuff like that
The collaboration between agencies and activities and
That 's a hard question ...
Like the routine things that happen , like the activities or events like the hot air balloons or the Memorial services and um and the car show downtown kind of thing .
Well they do n't live here , but I would hope that they would get to see the hot air balloons and that - I 'm stuck on hot air balloons .
To see the value of what we have-and different perspectives I guess .
I guess what I mean is that people do n't see the work behind the scenes - people making stuff happen and getting people more involved .
hmm , I have n't really thought about that - I guess , try to help them understand the value of it - I know it 's hard to get volunteers and that people are busy and working and
make a wish ... that 's a tough one ... to continue to improve what we have and promote what we have more I guess -
my mind 's a little blank , I guess

and I have n't driven a car in eleven years - and also I really appreciate CHAPS and the Journey Center because they have help make a quantum leap in my recovery of my mental illness-with peer consult-before I came here And then CHAPS hosted a series of presentations on things last summer and I could go-like Women 's Services , and other mental health agencies - and And I 've been told by my mental health services that Meadville has the best services of a lot of places -
Well , two of my classmates from second grade on live in Meadville and we still get together , and we 've been best friends for over 60 years .
At least once a week
Mostly my mental health services
um , my therapist gave me an application for parkside commons when she felt that I could undertake independent living
um , Second Saturday .
Well , that 's a bunch of vendors at the Market House , but they also have entertainment and activities for children on the second saturday of each month - on the other saturdays And then they have Meadville Fridays on the first Friday of the month .
I do n't know I do n't go , but a friend told me she likes to go to it , I think there 's food and vendors .
the Journey Center , because they are certified by Clubhouse and which means that we are part of an international network and we gain impressions and strength and weaknesses from all over the US - we do n't get much international contact-in fact the Journey Center is the only reason that I 'm not living in southern California now .

um-Snow . ( laughing )

but I graduated nursing school in NY state , moved to southern CA in 69 to 88 and worked in OH , NY , CA , PA in nursing
Well , I 'm sure there is presentations and seminars that they have-very extensive outreach to the community
No , like all the College students and Active Aging and Journey Center .

obert Smith_live in Meadville since 2003
Well , it has a lot close by so that you do n't have to do too much driving around . Um that 's all I can think of .
Um I do n't really know this town and I 've always lived out in the country and this is really the only time I spent in a bigger town in my whole entire life , so I do n't know much about this town .
It was family situation that I kind of do n't really want to get into .
Well , the town mainly , back in the 80s , because my grandparents were farmers , so we used to bring our grains and wool to the old feed mill and stuff , so I always been on the cultural farming part of the history
Mainly wool from the sheep - we pretty much had a beef farm .
That 's a hard one because I do n't really know the town or things like that .
I am pretty much a regular there during the summer time .
Like old town-sticking to their roots , sticking to tradition , remembering and learning from the past to try to make things better for the future and the present .
Figure out what worked and what did n't so that you could make sure that was still there for the future .
Hmmm , I really do n't have any comment .


Yeah , and you try to explain it , and if they have n't been there and done , they might have their idea - but you know what the truth is , and trying to explain the truth to an outsider is extremely hard .

um the Small town atmosphere - um easy to get around - I do n't know
yeah ( laughing ) - ok the big town atmosphere compared to where I live , but it 's more small town than big-comparatively
Yeah , like you can go in anywhere and most times I 'm gon na run into someone I know
Oh , jeez since I was 18 , so like 35 years
It 's close to where I live - It 's um - would I rather work in Cochranton if the agency was there , yeah , but its still close its only a 13 mile drive and its easy to get to and fro - so
and um yeah and social wise , you know my dart night with my friends and my bowling night with my friends
um , it was very social - and after working it provided a good way to release and vent ( laughing ) - and there was alcohol involved
There was no jobs in Cochranton ( laughing ) , so I mean my first job was at the Meadville mall , I worked at the card shop there and then that led to the AC , which led to here ( Supports , inc )
but like there 's not a whole lot around for them to access - like maybe ceramic classes or photography classes or it 's usually happening on nights or weekends , which does n't really accommodate a lot of our individuals
The people that we support out in the community - we have staff that work with individuals with disabilities who live in like family living or a group home .
When I think about Meadville , I think about the hockey team - and its the school - and how great they do - and excitement when the bus comes in and the parade - I guess town spirit when it comes to the High School anyhow-and the Halloween parade
Um , because it just reminds me of my school days - I mean you always want to be an adult in high school
And I think it brings the community together when they do really well at states and they come back and everybody is out there cheering , and it shows a great community . you know .
There are some restaurants that I like , like Compadres , and Applebees I really love and Cracker Barrell too .   So I guess I would miss food ( laughing ) and places to go do things .
yeah ( laughing )
I think uh , the community involvement-more involvement and the small town atmosphere of getting people together , I think um , it just makes a town naturally grow and it stops a lot of the bad things from maybe getting bigger .

Well , I would get something for high school students to do outside of school on nights and weekends

I like the fact that it seems like a small town , even thought its on the big side . People are very friendly .
Well , people open doors for you and people stop and let you cross the street .
Most of my favorite times are up here at CHAPS .
I love their holiday parties .
Christmas mostly .
Yeah , up on andolph Street
Well let 's just say that I left Conneautville not of my own choice
Like they have the mental health fair go on there , I think it was called the Second Saturday or something .
CATA bus . I have my own issues with them .
As long as they keep the sense of community .
I think getting involved with the community health fair-like at the Diamond or at the Mall
It seems pretty good , but like my issue with CATA bus is that in the winter time , their bus stops usually kept clear so its hard to catch the bus and they could use an extra bench or two here and there .
I think everything 's pretty good the way it is .
I ca n't think of anything right off hand ... I guess the only thing I would wish for is just more job opportunities sometimes - you know like everytime you see things in the paper , you need some kind of technical degree or something .
Well , like I said I 've been here about 3 years , and I 've really come to like it .

I love that they have so many different unique shops in this area that they offer to Meadville . Different stores , that other areas do n't have -
I think in this area is that   you serve individuals with disabilities -
and I love the fact that I can interact with individuals with disabilities , listen to their thoughts and their choices and decisions and help them to reach their goals and successes and help them be very independent community members too .
I have a son who has a disability - and there were so many doors that were always closing for him , and I have always been very passionate about wanting to open those doors
Well , if I lived in this area - if I was n't already drawn into a mortgage elsewhere that I 'm already in and if my son was n't already so far along in his schooling , that would be another factor to draw me into Meadville .
And because I work here , I hear about all the organizations doing events in the evening time and on the weekends , which is an interest too .



Keeping businesses local so they do n't close-finding out what is maybe the problems for businesses that may be on the verge of closing and what can we do to help them stay open-tying more businesses together so there is no overlapping of services , but

**excerpts:**
Sounds like a good idea .
I ’ve been a lot of different places in my life , but I do n’t really like the heat uh , so anywhere south of here would be a bad idea for me . But also I know the whole community , pretty much .
I think it ’s probably just the people that I ’ve known my whole life that do , that have come back here .
Good , when I was younger I played a lot of sports , I had a lot of friends , so I did pretty well in school . Umm .
But , yeah lot of too much fun in my teen years .
there are those kinds of things and there 's also , um , you know a lot of different walks and things they do downtown that bring a lot of business to the downtown stores and things like that .
And you know there is annual stuff , I 'm not excited about pushing him in a car seat or in a stroller this year at all . and you know like Thurston classic and everything else , that will be really fun .
Why do you like those types of things , like the vet thing ?
They give you adaptable things , they can help you install adaptable shower systems . So these people can take a shower and still live at home .
Were always finding ways to make it fun too , like there is a side activity happening like a dart game or golf or something . , you know mess around for fun , there is like an underlying good cause to it .
I do them probably on a month or bimonthly basis , but definitely when the weather is better we have better turn outs for different things .
I like harassing local vendors to offer you know , prizes for people to donate even more money so for instance , uh , you know , in Conneaut lake . Antonio 's donated a twenty five dollar gift card to auction off .
You know , like calling them , you know on the phone , asking them to donate . Do you want to come to this , do you want to support this ?
No , well yes . and I 'm pretty sure the Meadville PD . I would just make a couple phone calls , make sure I followed up . but they bought those tickets and
but yeah I 'd say that it 's a huge thing for my group , age group twenty five maybe and above that they do like to do that as a social , it 's their social time and
" And if we are friends and they are n't doing anything that day they buy a ticket and come .
I know that we had a lot of different things happen when I was younger that gave Meadville some attention . and she was like one of the youngest people whatever distance I ca n't remember the specifics but it got a lot of national attention here .
But yeah there were definitely things that gave us like some national attention , especially back when I was younger that I remember were really cool . Or maybe not just specifically like that but something with positive attention .
And I know that the high school athletics have been really good lately , gotten us a lot of positive attention which is great .
I know that in high school our journalism group that we had for writing in the school newspaper when I was a sophomore and Junior was really interesting . We were covering a presidential election and it was a big deal for us .
Yeah it was like a pageant thing , like I was not in it . And it was like a huge deal because we were all like fifteen and sixteen years old and they were all in it at once and the whole community was pretty much there .
Some want to do it and they keep wanting to do it until they are fifteen or sixteen and they are like I never want to do that . Or they just never want to be on a stage . That 's not me
Why did I want to do that ? Actually , uh to be honest one hundred percent on that I went to , I joined the military right after 9/11 I had six months of college under my belt And I was gone until I was twenty one .
I left for my initial like gear up for training , I had to drop out of college in November of 2003 and I did n't come back until February of 2006 .
Nineteen to twenty one I was like just turning twenty and then I was just turning twenty one when I came back . So my whole twenty to twenty first year .
Well I finished school but I was n't having the best time at life .
And my mom was here and she was n't having the greatest time at life either , and
No it 's definitely not there are definitely people way above me that are management . But I do supervise people directly . And I mainly supervise the lives of because I do n't really supervise , I supervise my staff .
Well I was going through trouble too so I just wanted to be with my mom .
yeah , it 's there you know . There is no reason if you are n't doing anything else even if it does n't meet your expectations maybe some day it will meet other expectations .
And I had a son , and It 's debatable to say whether or not I have great health insurance , but I have good health insurance and for me
It 's a neurological disease that eventually will leave me to be probably eventually severely physically disabled .. But um yeah , having health insurance is very important , and I have been good health insurance .
I do n’t know it my personality would fit the “ for-profit ” industry anymore .
like if my personality would fit the “ go , go , go ” of a for-profit industry .
No we do n’t It ’s a huge thing for us .
And like I said , my mom works there
We used ot have Conneaut Lake park events or train ride at Titusville events and my mother would be like “ Lindsay , we ’re going to Conneaut Lake park ! ” then we ’d go and it would be a work event
And then so staff and our special services are going to be there ’re like , “ oh by the way , you can bring your kids ” and I ’m like ..

Yeah it ’s really good It ’s nice .
There ’s always the same fair .
And I think that the tourism in Meadville , it ’s small tourism
And it would be the same way for our fairgrounds or for here , like if there were any ideas that it would go away , it would mobilize people to make sure to do anything that could happen to keep it here .
I mean like to see them get bigger and better
No , absolutely not .

On the outskirts of Meadville , it ’s a big deal . That 's the thing , managing expectations that something big would come into meadville because we really do


And when we are in bad weather , we are rough , we are . ’re I would be really iT ’s long to be in but is really fun , we ’re a short hike away from it
Like , not minimum wage jobs , we have a ton of those . I know several people that have 2 or 3 jobs at a time
i ’m pretty sure they do n’t ask at all , and if they do it ’s in the Tribune as a poll and you only have the people that read the Tribune that participate .   Not hating on the Tribune at all , and they   have a ’s pretty   much it .

**excerpts:**
you go there and around there like I think of Saegertown –
Just like-looking around Diamond Park here , so many churches , so many places that have always been here for as long as I ’ve been alive and a lot longer , and
I remember when they stone blasted that Stone Methodist Church back in the late ‘ 60s ‘ 70s , it was black , just because it had been there so long , and they sandblasted it to clean it ’s been there
– we were involved in a church in Waterford for over 20 years and I sort of always felt bad about that because … my parents would have loved to have had us come back while they were alive , but …
Walking downtown ! – I met my friends and we walked to like Woolworths and Murphys and whatever else was down there at the time .
Clothing stores , Weldon ’s , JC Penneys … There was another movie theater down there , but we always just went to the Academy .
Basketball games , high school – I liked school – I liked learning – that sounds corny , but – hey -you got ta see your friends !
The high school football games , basketball games , the courthouse
So , that building I think adds a lot to the town in this area of the Diamond Park .
The churches , Allegheny College – that was always a part of my growing up because my grandma worked there .
She managed the bookstore – til , well , when my grandfather was alive , they ran the student union grill , then he passed away and then I think she ran the grill for a little while longer , then she went to manage the bookstore until ’ 65
I ’m glad the police department is on Diamond Park .
During the good weather , summer , early fall Now , I love kids , I ’m all for having kids , but   you know , sometimes you feel a little – there ’s groups
Well , see , Diamond Park may be very safe , I just feel uncomfortable in it at night – I do And I ’m not saying it has , that ’s just how I feel .
Cause this is sort of a public place n’t ’ know that I am unsafe in reality
There ’s that new clothing store .
I thought it was in the mall .
I mean anybody could buy stuff there but it was n’t like out of this world . I like having Peebles there , like at Christmas time and I want to buy something , like not at Walmart .
And keep the YMCA going strong .   My older brother , when he was a teenager , worked at the YMCA and his whole life was YMCA .   I still get letters and notes all the time “ Everytime
Ok , to have a new YMCA – brand new , new pool , new basketball court .   I do n’t ’ know , I ca n’t think of anything .
Oh , yeah - I have a couple friends who go early in the morning whenever they open Now maybe in the middle of the day it ’s not so crowded , I do n’t know .
But things that could have happened in Wichita .
Except one time – ummm – I think it was right there where those trees are !
I think so – Mary Sue Prather was my friend and we were down town , a bunch of us , and her dad ’s office , he was a lawyer , he worked there , it was a brick building , and it went down –
It was a Saturday , and I was just like , and my parents knew him , and I was like , I just thought we were all going to be arrested , but it was Mary Sue –

**excerpts:**
Okay , I 'm Melanie Cosdon , I 'm 13 and I go to Meadville Area Middle School
Um .. I do a lot of the arts , i act a lot . I sing and I dance . I do n't like to draw or point , i 'm not very good at it but i like ceramics .
Well i have an 18 year old sister . And she 's going to college this year . I kind of learned a lot from her . I live with my dad . He shows me broadway shows and yeah , that 's how i really got into theater .
Yeah , yeah .
she 's a therapist and has her own practice .
Yeah and she 's certified to teach yoga .
I think like mid august , i 'm not sure
Well during a school day , i like to wake up at 650 but its usually like 7 o'clock , 710 am and i walk to school most days Sometimes i have lie extra curricular activities or like i m on student council and have meetings .
I 'm doing a couple camps like creativing landscapes . I m also doing Camp Notre Dame , which is more traditional . Canoeing , bow and arrow , stuff like that .
Yeah , trying .
and sometimes you 'll be allowed on certain websites and some are blocked . Even youtube is blocked but there 's a way to get around that . People found sneaky ways .
And , i like going to the really cheap movies , because it 's just a fun thing to do and it might not always be a good movie Consider yourself lucky to have never been in a movie theater with me because we 're really obnoxious .
I love when that happens
Sometimes I like to bike to the top of the parking garage and look around .
Yeah , that 's the one , it 's a lot of fun .
Well I have a regular smartphone . And we have a computer at home and it 's so old . I feel like it 's one of those big box ones from the 90s and its very angry a lot .
We have an xbox that connects to our tv and we play videogames on there . But mostly i 'm on my phone .
I know people who do but we use the kinect to dance and do sports on it .
Very very often , i usually have my phone on my person all the time , like now . It makes me feel safer to have it , you feel more connected with people .
I do n't really use the computer too much but the occasional game . I watch TV probably and hour and a half to two hours a day . and my phone all day .
I like to watch buzzfeed videos and i have the buzzfeed app on my phone . And I have a lot of social media on my phone like snapchat and instagram .
I use instagram the most and i do n't think email counts but i have that .
I do n't think enough of my friends are online , i know my sister has it but that 's like , twitter is more her , its older . And facebook is just like , my parents use it , so i do n't .
Benefits are , its easier to make plans , just a quick text away or a snapchat throughout the day . you do n't know if they 're going to call back or not . or like there 's definitely like cyber bullying and all that stuff .
We have like all of that Amazon videos too .
Oh definitely stranger things .
Its a bit dated but Buffy the Vampire Slayer , i 'm a very fantasy , mystery type person , that 's also the books i read .
Sometimes you 'll feel like " it 's breaking , what do i do ? I 've never dropped my phone in water and had to put it in rice my sister has though . My dad once had his tablet run over .
Well the computer is in the upstairs study . And my sister usually uses that one for school work when she was in high school . My dad brings his tablet with him to work .
The really old laptop is floating around somewhere in the house . My mom has a newer laptop that she uses at her office .
Oh yeah , but sometimes i 'll be sneaky and say that i 'm leaving it out and my parents will be like " So you did have it in your room " and i 'll say i got up in the middle of the night or morning .
" hey look at funny things " .
I think that i 'm using it the regular amount for kids my age and that kinda scares me because i know i 'm on it kinda a lot .
I have the buzzfeed app that keeps me updated and has some quizzes and games that i enjoy . I do n't really have any games on my phone because i 'm very low on storage . I have a lot of music on my phone .
Because like , this school year we were allowed to have our phones on us so long as they were on silent or turned off completely . At the end of the school year after the award ceremony , where they give like honors and stuff and
I do n't like Spotify or pandora or websites like that . I usually have my phone on a play app . I buy the music and then put it on my phone . Or I get some illegal music apps or download it right off of youtube .
I 'm not a very pop music type of person so like , in the high school on friday , sometimes they 'll play music between classes . Usually its more popular songs or the ones at school dances .
It 's just a wide range of functionalities that instagram does . It has stories now which i do n't use , i find it a bit tedious . they 're trying to take over more sites .
But they 'll be like " look at this cool rock " or " this tree is weird " things like that . Instagram is more like a picture app for if you did something cool
A lot i guess . You want people to know what you 're up to and when you 're doing cool things .
I post things about my birthday or someone else birthday , Last day of school .
I guess I create a lot of my own content . I get irritated with people who just post quotes or something and stuff like that . There are other people who really like to do it for attention and will post hints .
Oh yeah .
You can really get good feeling from seeing the clothes I wear and what I do . Or like , I post updates on shows i 'm in like " we work real hard on this , come check it out " . So definitely
I 'd like to think i am . I do n't know how to put this , like not being fake online . The main thing is try to be you doing , just cause , like trying to make it look natural .
I think people would probably be less narcissistic because there 's a big thing about followers and likes on a picture . " I did n't get too many likes on this picture , i should take it down because people do n't like it .
My family does n't really have those modern social media apps . I know my grandparents have facebook and that 's how they communicate with my sister sometimes .
I think Meadville is good at supporting local businesses or projects like Grow Meadville who had local bands and art shows . I do a lot of my art in the market house over the summer and that was fun .
Yeah , i think they should because it 's a good way to catalog your memories each day . Yeah there are pictures but it 's better to show people .
I do n't know . I do n't think i have the power because i m 13 and living in a very small city . But there are accounts that are making people more aware of things like wildlife research type things .
Success i think to me is , like , being , happy with how your life is going . I think that 's pretty much society 's version of success . I guess societies version could also be lie how many friends or how much money .
Not necessarily because like , if you 're happy with yourself , why would you need to show these pictures off . But it could be good , i mean ...
Yeah , honestly . Because like , it ll give you more of a feeling of what people are like and what type of effort they 'll put into what they 're doing .
Oh yeah .
I would like to be either a marine biologist or a space engineer .
Probably because like you said people are going back to make sure you 're not a garbage person .
I think its pretty good , i think they 'll cringe when they see me at this age but i 've also gone back and seen my hair cut and i m making weird faces .
Like fidget spinners
Every trend or fad that comes out is all " we should all do this " and after a month two , the perspective changes and everyone 's like " oh , it 's so weird " . and it usually is .
When i first got a smartphone , like a year and a half ago . I got my first phone when i was in like 5th grade . and that was like a slide up phone . so i painted the back with nail polish .
I was excited about all the different apps and i wanted to show people my life and what i was doing . And i wanted one because all the other people had one
like i know i 'm going to italy for a month in the fall , it 's so that when we 're away we can still do our work and it 's easier to be connected . Like we are a small city .
I think it 's also pretty advanced . I mean like , you guys have all the computers in the library and the TV in the gyms . Do you guys do a lot of work on the computers here ?
Well , there 's a positive effect because you can tell what people are doing and what things are in . You can be more connected which is a pro social media thing to say but cyber bullying is a thing at our school

# My Meadville Transcribing.docx
**sum:**
**excerpts:**
I love all the community events like second Saturday where you can go and have fun with your friends or family , and I like all the locally owned shops such as creative crusts and tattered corners , and I like that there is not a lot of crime here
Um my favorite memory is in the summer I would go to the farmer ’s market with my parents and then we 'd go to creative crusts and get bread and we would have tons of fun .
My dad got a job here and so we moved here and I stayed because of my parents .
Having more places to hang out with my friends and more places to shop at .
The big zipper where all the people contributed pieces to it and all the road signs out by giant eagle .
Um , creative crusts because I go there practically every weekend and its , you can just sit there and talk or you can like eat its its really nice .
Um , its important to continue community events and uh having low crime rate .
To have more shopping options like build a better mall or expand the downtown mall to have more places that teenagers would like to shop at like H&M or like forever 21 or Hollister , places like that .
1 homer
2 ?
3 ?
1 Was it hard to find the place ?
1 Uh I was born and raised here so I like it , you know . People ya know I get along with the people you know the ones I know , so ............
1 Get you to your appointments if ya need to go to an appointment .
1 Yup .
1 Uh , they ’re mostly , the ones I know are mostly friendly . Ya know everybody knows everybody around here . So its not really that big of a town , but , but everybody knows everybody , everybody gets along with everybody .
1 Its a friendly little town like like a Mayberry .
1 Friendly nice people you know you have have have to ask any question any directions you get the right person and they ’re show you right where it is .

1 And now its like I you know I do n’t watch it on TV , I listen to it .
1 But I ’m starting to get the hang of it ya know you just got ta take it day by day the best I can .
1 Yea they they use like a ... When I go to a meeting they ’ll call me up and they ’ll send somebody up they ’ll call me tell me what time they ’re gunna come and them they ’ll come and get me .
1 Um keystone .
1 You was talkin to me ?

1 How would I describe Meadville you sayin ?
1 Oh . Being able to get around I mean I been here all my life so I know most of the things and sights and people Ya know I ride the cat bus every while before I was blind so I know where my stops are and everything
and then the keystone line like You know charges and then we 'll pay them to take us down there . n’t like to drive in the big city anyways so .
1 Um ... Top wish . I wish just everybody could get along ya know . Ya know have that where you know ....
1 Yea everybody could get along .
1 But um yea Ya know with me not having my sight I see how things could be and how you are treated ( pause ) so .
1 Naw not really , I ca n’t say I really do . 'Cause I ’m that I ’m the type of person I get along with anybody so . Um . Naw I do n’t have no story about that .
1 Just growing up here was fun . Just Meadvilles a nice little old town .
1 Yea we we found stuff to do you know , go up to Allegheny college , play up there and play basketball up there and stuff on their courts . Now its like you ca n’t really do it , you know . They do n’t
1 You know like kids now gettin out like we used to . There used to be baseball fields you used to be able to go to play baseball all day . Stuff like that .
1 Ah ha yea that ’s right up the street .
1 Yea .
1 Oh yea I guess it would be an opportunity I just ai n’t been up there in so long . You know they got swimming in the rec and the ice skatin rink and the roller I think they got roller skating in the summertime .
1 Oh they do n’t . Oh ok see its how long its been .
1 Oh do they ?
1 Yea a skateboard park .
1 Yea . It used to be one over that hill , where rat lake is . They call it rat lake .
1 Yea we from Meadville too ?
1 Oh ok
1 Yea you get a lot of opportunities if you know the right people . There ’s a lot opportunities around here .
1 As far s going to school . Ya know get a nice education . They got a good school system . Um ( pause )
Just , for me it be my friends , 'cause I got a lot of friends . And since I ’ve been in this situation I ai n’t been around I ai
2 I ’ve lived here all my life , that ’s why it feels like home
1 I told them Meadvilles a lot of friendly people around here .
2 Its just a nice quiet calm town , I , this is the best pace to raise your children . It really is !
2 There is n’t much that ’s one thing that Meadville needs to do is they need to get something for our teens our pre - teen adults .
1 Keep them off the streets
2 There ’s nothing for them to do to keep them off the streets . I remember when I was younger , they had up y-teens , they had um , arcade places , they had um …
1 The parks used to be open in the summertime
They used to have summer parks , children go to the summer park do crafts , games , they do n’t have the no , College kids used to even go to the parks , and up they did a lot of crafts and stuff with the kids .
1 Elm   street .
2 Elm street .
1 Yea
2 And that ’s more like um they do school supplies stuff for the children , the needy children , and then they do a little carnival along with it . I think that ’s the only exciting thing Meadville has for out children .
2 What are those skates called ? Uh ..
2 No , the big long wood things ...
2 Skate , they have skating board up there . But , you got ta have this to be able to get in and enjoy that . You know , I I think Meadville needs to concentrate more on our children .
1 How long have I been blind , about four years ?
2 About five years .
1 Five years
2 Yea
1 Tell 'em you know I used to go to the basketball court the college and you know play basketball , baseball , used to have baseball fields , softball .
They wonder why the crime rate is getting high in Meadville , and it is , I mean I can remember when I was 15 years old I mean we were a close community , and now its like , there ’s ...
1 I told them it was like Mayberry
2 Yea mmhmm yea almost like Mayberry , but now you 've got a lot of people moving into Meadville um . and so therefore they 're robbing homes , um , drug trafficking , you know but I just think Meadville need stuff for our children .
3 You never thought about drugs ago in Meadville .
2 No ! !
3 But way back because they used to do they do n’t do that . But now they ’re out there on the street trying to bring people in . Kids in .
2 I I think that ’s the only complaint I have in Meadville , because the hospitality is very nice for Meadville .
1 Yea that ’s why I said it be like home .
2 Meadvilles beautiful , um …
1 Getting along with a lot of people .
2 ight , I I think that the main thing I do n’t like about Meadville .
A long long lime ago they had a segregation , but now that they broke up the segregation , and now they ’re hand in Where before in the years back there was . A long time ago like back , back in the 60s and the ...
2 But that was everywhere , that want just Meadville .
3 But then they got rid of it .
I think that my chief complaint in Meadville . Other than that I love Meadville . Um , but to wanna move somewhere now , I love Meadville its my home town .
1 Yea I would wanna be in Meadville you know the grandkids could get an education here .
2 Yea , there ’s just nothing for children here , nothin . Nothin at all . I think that would be the biggest thing I would want Meadville to work on is something for our children .
you could go up there to Shady Brook , Heidi Cooper , parks up by the school , a lot of parks , and    there ai n’t hardly any parks anymore and um they like I said um Allegheny had a lot of their students that would open up the parks and they would just have crafts and games , and I used to have to go drag my children home because they would be up there , I think that ’s my biggest problem .
2 Yea I think Allegheny has done , Allegheny students has done a lot , for our children , um like that ramp um for say that ramp um Allegheny students come down and built that ramp for my husband . If it was n't   for them building that ramp , it took us a good 20 minutes to get homer out of the house .
3 I ’m not quit sure I I ca n’t I ca n’t recall it
2 Um they help the handicapped   and the elder you now if the elder needed a roof done the Allegheny   students did that and ...
1 Habitat for Humanity ?
3 And they go in and they paint houses for people .
2 No ...
2 Um I do n’t know the name of it but they just they do , I , the only people that do a lot for our community is the Allegheny students , I must say if it was n’t for the Allegheny students
2 Yup , it , I , I I prop all the students up there , I truly do . They built my ramp for my husband .
Meadville tribune was here too I ’m crying I was so overwhelmed because I ’m like my god There was times where ...... 'Cause it was a burden to get him out of the house so …
2 Yea I think that ’s my , that ’s my main focus .
1 And they do n’t have no curfews now .
2 And you see all these young children and they just hang at country fair .
1 Yup .
2 Yea .
1 And they do n’t have curfews . Do they ...
2 What ’s that ?
1 They do n’t have curfews no more .
2 No they used to have curfews , they do n’t .
2 It says " how might we improve the strength of our community ? "
That ’s a really hard answer . n’t think we have a bad community . n’t think our community is not strong , because if there is somebody in need
2 I dunno .
3 A lot of older people are afraid to walk downtown . Nowadays compared to what it was last year .
I guess for your question where its says , " if you were in control of the cities budget , what would you improve ? I think again I think I would improve the funds for them to do stuff with our children . I can remember growing up ....
1 Transportation
3 Yea but I , I also would improve the the more more for the sidewalks for the blind people too .
2 They ’re doing that the ...
3 The sidewalks are bad and uh they need more improvement . Because if I was disa .. I ’m not disabled but I ca nt I would n’t be able to walk downtown I got one of those jazzys , which I got ta get a battery for yea
2 Yea the sidewalks are bad .
3 I do n’t think I could do that on the sidewalks with the jazzy ....
1 You got ta walk in the street .
3 They tried to take him downtown in the wheelchair ....
2 Actually you ’re right because I witness when I ’m working at the store ill see a lot of elderlys driving their jazzys in the road so …
3 Yea because the sidewalks ai n’t ai n’t ai n’t cape ... Or ai n’t good for them , jazzys or anything .
2 Yea we tried pushing him downtown in a wheelchair and its difficult
3 She could n’t get it through the uh rough parts of its cement of the uh ... Sidewalk
2 We had to pull him backwards .
3 And they , I think they need more room the sidewalks . For the blind and the elderly , I really do .
3 There ’s a lot of stuff that they need to do that uh they ...
3 Yea it one thing the blinded have the the canes they have the ball ; they would n’t be able to walk down there . Because the ball would get stuck in prolly one of these holes or ruts .
2 I think that ’s the only thing I have a problem in in Meadville I ’m not dishappy ...
3 I ’m not unhappy about Meadville , I like living here .
2 I love Meadville I love it here , um I just that ’s the main thing if I were to be able to do somethin I would focus on something for children , especially poverty children , and we have a lot that here . We really do .
3 I want to focus on I want for the blind to ...
2 Well yea , but I ’m saying I want for children too mom , there ’s a lot of them that hang on the streets and get in trouble and ...
3 I know I know and its not good for them ..
2 There ’s nothing for them to do .
2 eally ?
1 Is that bad ?
2 It never used to be like that either , like I said you could leave your doors unlocked at night and go to bed and sleep sound and knowing ....
3 I lock all my windows and doors .
’s car , but they robbed here car . Actually my grandson was having a sleepover and they were all camping out front before the ramp was built , and they were all had their sleeping bags stuff on the porch
3 I ’d be afraid to been outside .
2 I think that ’s the only , problem I have with Meadville . That I I must prop and I do n’t know where to go to prop you Allegheny students but you guys do a lot for our community .
1 Yea
2 Allegheny does do a lot for the community they really do . Many things . I ca n’t even think of all the stuff they do but .
2 That ’s wonderful there too yea . You know what , you ’re right , um , my brother goes every year and the the income tax Allegheny students help with income tax , do the income tax .
1 Yea at the library ?
2 I really do n’t have any more to add that ’s ...
that you know we need more stuff for children to do .
3 Your grandchildren ai n’t all grown up .
2 Well they ’re …
3 Antwon ai n’t and neither is Devante .
2 No I ’m talking about the ones that are n’t hanging on the street that have are able to go out by themselves and be able to do something .
3 ight .
2 The little ones ca nt , but that ’s my main focus I would wanna say is for the children .
1 Mmhmm .
2 Yea and what about , out summer days um when they used to have the sidewalk sales downtown . I mean , we we ’ve got businesses .
3 There ai n’t no down town anymore .
2 We do have businesses downtown .
3 Not a whole lot .
They used to all get together ’d look forward that it would be the whole weekend and they would have a little carnival and stuff like that down there , um , and I ca nt remember what it was called , but it was always in , august …
They had the diamond park closed off for our teens and had bands going up there They do n’t do that anymore , you do n’t see no downtown sidewalks anymore , no carnivals downtown …
1 Nothin .
2 Nothin . Sometimes you wonder if Meadvilles becoming a ghost town …
Chelsea Lee Tucker
Um , it its a place where you can get help for mental illness .
And they also give you shelter for homelessness .
Um , I think that ’s about it .
No , just since before Christmas for like two days .
I think so yea .
Um , the help .
Mmmm , the people .
They ’re nice .
No nothing .
CVS , Walgreens , uh , the mall .
And um the read program .
Hush . I ’m not quite sure .
I want go there .
It is . I want to um read better , do math better , do social studies and science better .
It will help me pass exam like the SATs and the uh exam to get into college .
I ’m thinking about going for CNA to help be an N.
Well , um , I saved two people in my lifetime , and I liked doing it so ...
Well my sister was drowning in a swimming pool . Uh , this guy I brought home ended up with a car that fell on top of him ...
Um , they help you to learn how to live independently .
The help .
Um , learning to live independently .
The confusion of walking around .
Having somebody who can walk around with me .
Everything being in like the same block .
Um . I made some good friends here .
Um no that ’s it .

we would say well why are you waving , and he would say , well you wave at people , you wave to be friendly , and
Well , the main reason that I am here is because my family is here-my mother is here , my sisters and their families are here , I 'm raising my family here and um that 's probably
and there 's 8 years between 5 of us , And of course places , like driving out by the hippy farm-back in the 60s that was a big deal Meadville Memories ' remember driving by the hippy farm ? '
And honestly , if I was a more independent person I think I probably would have by now gone somewhere south , a little warmer , the older I get the harder the winters ' get , um but in order for me to do that at this point
Well , I joke , but global warming might really be a benefit to us ...


Well , I would miss the Diamond - I would definitely miss Allegheny College - I think that the college brings so much to the town from interesting people to interesting students to opportunities for growth and employment .  
whether its about what are we gon na do about traffic on N Main St to different things along those lines -
So , that would be my - if there could be another industry , if there could be a way for there to be higher level opportunities for people that would either encourage people to come or encourage people to stay - that would be great .
I am really concerned about the heroine / opioid epidemic - and I really see it

**excerpts:**
Meadville is the most special place in the world to me . The question is sot of asking It ’s a deep feeling . A character in the motion picture Field of Dreams summed it up best “

I was born and raised in Meadville . I made a conscious choice to come back after college because it mattered more to me to be here than it did what I would be doing here . Even when I eventually retire , I will stay in Meadville .
More viable retail downtown . A men ’s clothing store . A true department store . Not a Wal Mart . More varied restaurants . Being able to buy the majority of needed goods and service downtown .
Parades and gatherings downtown ... A memorial Day observance that attracts hundreds of people and concerts in Diamond Park . Small town America at it Small independent business which add character and flavor to our town .
Diamond Park . Market House . It ’s not one thing , Meadville is n’t one thing . Meadville is a collection of churches , stores , offices , arts , people who make them all thrive .
Our sense of history and place of time . You can not move forward without understanding the history which brought you to where you are now .
How the community is a whole , and how everyone works together to make it better . And how nobody is left out in our community , everybody is friends with everybody .
Most every problem we face as a community can be solved with talents of those who are already here . We must put our resources and hard work into what we value and not wait for someone close to do it .

**sum:**
**excerpts:**
The summer is the best part . And really that kind of plays into the fact that pretty much about anywhere in town you are about 5 minutes away from being almost in the middle of nowhere . The summer times lends itself to spending more time outside .
what 's really nice is - so there are about three ravines So they are doing more tree management up there There are a couple of Beech trees up at obertson that are pretty big - they 're probably like 60 , 70 years old .
Not necessarily solo activities but small groups maybe 4 or 5 people - But usually its either by myself or with one other person - they 're like getaways .
The city of Meadville itself has got the things that you need -like grocery stores , laundry mats , pharmacies , whatever . um 90 minutes south you got Pittsburgh about 2 hours west
And What so cool about that is the water that 's up in Minnesota in like lake Superior does eventually filter down and come into lake Erie . So Its really one giant fresh water way which is really cool and like
Not polluting it , not abusing - just making sure that it is - that continues to be the resource that we want it to be - you know natural resource .
You know French Creek - when I drove out to Chataqua ,   I crossed the french creek and whoo   - the waterway again is just an immense ecological system . How do you think that we are as a local entity managing our water resources ?
I think you can look at it a few different ways.so , When I think of french creek I think of french creek conservancy -
You know lately there 's the big talk about The Meadville water source where we get out water from .
I think there 's 3 major wells that they pump water out of . you know really accessible water not that far down . One of the big conversations right now , is like well how do we manage the water source ?
Its not really the city because the city does n't have water authority , I don if the entity that manages the water supply is a for profit - I imagine that it is .
- she grew up there , went to high school , went to college , and then she got a job at the Iroquois club She was the manager of the Iroquois Club back in like the early 80s late 70s .  
On Arch so its kind of the funny area where chestnut splits off and turns in to alden so I Grew up there-after high school left and then 4 years ago moved back .
After high school I did a year at Juniata College in Central PA , then I dropped out , and then I moved to Colorado for a bit- So both my parents were First generation college students , so it was important for kids to go to college too . I went to Denison University in Ohio , was there for 3 years , got my degree then moved to detroit MI . I was there for 2 and a   half years roughly , then i moved back here .
So-  in the meantime i had gone down to panama was living with   a college roommate of mine who was doing like Peace Corps . so I Started doing promotional videos , and one of the promotional videos was for Voodoo Brewery . like hey let me make make some videos for you guys and they 're and it 's like a week before the event .
Yeah - there were so many people , there was so much food , and I think at the time all they had was-a refrigerator , a steel table , two hot plates , and a big steam kettle and that was it - , it was pretty nuts .
No , they have it all around , they are a fairly new thing , but as the craft brew industry has grown , they 've become more popular , but yeah any of your more successful breweries do these barrel-room releases and basically what it is

You would always hear these arguments like Voodoo , its so expensive , or I do n't like that beer it tastes like whatever - and you typically think of that as kind of being a long kind of class divides . You would have guys and groups of people coming over from CNJ Industries , from SecoWarick , you know , you fundamental laborers would come into Voodoo and enjoy the beer , but then you would also have you know the people who owned those businesses - the people who owned these multi - million dollar industries in town . And then because it 's so new - and
I do n't know if they highlight different beers at different locations or if they have a special beer based on those locations , I do n't think so .
Oh , definitely , they 're a beer on the national stage - they win national awards , they 're arguably one of the breweries in the country - yeah
So in Voodoo you saw this cross section of people getting along together sharing different views of the world , are there any other venues in the city where you see that happening ?


So I went to East End elementary school for a while , and I grew up walking to that school
I would like to see more sports leagues , like there 's a new volleyball club or volleyball group and they 've got these sand courts over at 5th ward
And I think games were like 7 minutes , so you would play 3 on 3 for 7 minutes take a break , play another game - they were amazing and they were such a huge event .
I was just knocked down , I started getting sick Thursday , and then Friday I 'm like man and Saturday I was like I was garbage - and then this Saturday out at Conneaut Lake is the ice house fest , similar concept ,
And they do happen , I think one of the most challenging things is communicating with other people that it 's going on - um we do n't have a singular news source that informs people of all the different events - Meadville Calendar is one , um you know the Tribune does an alright job of getting stuff publicized , but only if you send it in-very rarely are they doing outreach about it .
I think the EAD program is a great addition to the area - the robotics program in Meadville is super cool - you know having more stuff like that would be really advantageous .
But I think we have seen so many people who want to do stuff and want to get involved , but they do n't necessarily know what else is going on or what the timeline is or what groups exist

**excerpts:**
you know , i used to be , I was a shy child , but then I became a teacher and you have to be assertive , so .... now I 'm crazy
I taught in southwestern , pa and then when we moved here I taught in ....
40 miles north of pittsburgh
You do n't know what part ?
Oh ! You 're kidding . My parents best friends lived in Dormont .
Well she just died .
She 's been dead for a while .
No . Well there is   but not in this life .
I grew up in a little town of 1500 peple , and it is okay these words are hard for me to remember even at my old age ... density means lots of people , right ?
Yes , well that 's the kind of place i grew up in . So evertyhings within a half an hour or ten minutes . and I 'd have to drive a long ways for ... I mean , H&H is there , but ...
The Saegertown Hardware 's great . So . That is ... but hten , umm ... things that somebody is involved with ... and I ca n't remember ... 'cause like Lee and a bunch of the ... and yourself .... everybody seems to kinda be ....
... together . yeah . And we have a block party at our center tomorrow that all these different configurations
Fairview Fairmont ? up on the hill ....
Anyway , um , so they 're trying to revive the City parks programs that used to be in all the parks and that was something I liked when my children ... I have a 24 and a 20 year old .
What i do n't like is to get anything continuously cultural nature although that 's improving too , slowly . You have to go an hour or 45 minutes away .
I have n't gone there yet , but boy , it looks it looks uh like top class ? high class ? So there are some good things about . I think a lot of good things are happenign now that have n't been going on .
To me ? Opportunities for people that are younger than me .
Umm like the community gardens and programs like all the things that are happening new now . Because Meadville is gon na continue to be drained of young people if young people do n't continue to be part of it .
So unless we keep adding things that are gon na attract people , then um , things are n't gon na get any better .
and when all the tool and dies closed , it was kinda like it 's helpfess because you know ... it takes a while . It takes about 20 years . ( wind )
they had an ice rink in Shafer auditorium many years ago for Beauty and the Beast and people who have lived here who have retired from the hostpital said they never have anything cultural like that in Meadville ever in all their years .
And that was the kind of thing I grew up doing . My Parents would take me to pittsburgh for different things . So . um .
NO . Because I 'm really busy . I work every day of the week .
I work at Fairview Fairmont Outreach Center . I 'm the assistant director there but I also work as a private contractor ....
Oh well we have programming for any resident that lives there from birth through time they go .... this is recorded so I ca n't say that too loud ... social services pretty much .
DUring the school year , we have uhhh homework help and tutor time for schoolage children . We 're having the block party tomorrow . We had a carnival celebrating the end of the school year just recently and ....
and this was midway point because my husband at the time was working at a job in Bradford worked there one day . Had also been offered a second job in Mercer , so he was going 12 months a year
Well not actually he and I have changed jobs . He 's still in the same system ,   but I"m not doing what I was been . But yeah , once you buy a house and all that kind of stuff you get established .
I have thought over the years of leaving .
; Our families are in southwestern PA . We do n't have anybody up here . at all .
Not a single person . And it 's a hundred miles to go see anybody in our family or you know 45 minutes if we go see my brother . He 's in Ohio and ....
Well , yeah , with working you kinda ca n't uhmmm and frankly I 'm getting old and I ca n't make that 2 hours down and 2 hours back and I ca n't make it any more haha .
Well , I do n't want them to give up their lives , quite frankly , I have another career exploration I have to fill before I croak .
I 've always wanted to be , I have a degree in music education and a masters beyond that but uhmm when I start teaching in this area , I had enough special needs students that I wanted to do music therapy
Events and people volunteering for them and their interest level
Oh just like the Thurston Classic which just happen recently .
I participated recently in the first time it 's that First Friday event where they had Josh somebody or other I ca n't think of his last name but and I had just gotten our haircut I do n't know if you read about it different sites .
We need to continue to provide for the less fortunate .
We need to not give , not do handouts but uhmmm and they 've got to be interested to . We 've ran into that issue uhmm help them find the services they need so that they also are successful .
Oh yea , women 's services there 's a lot of them .
Well my two are already grown so they had a good school system uhmmm they got to participate in sports in this area they also got to participate in music uhhhh cultural events . It 's a good place .
High school . Now I went to a high school that is similar in size 200 people in my graduating class . We knew everybody and that did n't bother us a bit . State , Ohio State that they could feel a little more anonymous .
I think that I 've done my job and they need to decide on their own .
I exposed them to all different things so it 's hard to tell .
Everybody says there used to be a whole lot more stores that you could choose from . I came there was the whole mall complex where Vernon Place is now and ...
Enough they can afford .
If we did n't have the CATA bus at all ? Seriously because some of these people ca n't walk or they the good thing about Meadville is
Yeah yeah go your mother sends you down for a loaf of bread or ...
Yeah and you ca n't do that here . Now I did when I first moved here . I do , I was living on Walnut and I would walk all the way to Valesky 's and back but that was me in fitness ... That 's just ...
For everybody to have the opportunities . Everybody has equal opportunities . Access to whatever they need to live a acceptable .
Food , clothing , decent housing .
I think we do we have a homeless shelter for men , we have women 's services
you know for women and children uhm we have section 8 housing and low income housing but I think we have waiting lists too for those things .
if somebody is trying to raise a family on like $ 9.50 and hour and most jobs are part time now so they do n't have to pay benefits .
And it 's a matter of choices too . and I 've said to my colleague yesterday you know " we need to say something like this to the adults too " they need to make good choices .
Getting married to your you know or not getting married and having three sets of kids to three different you know you know but they had the choice . Why would you do it a second or third time ?
Yes of course .

I like the small town atmosphere and I enjoy some of the things you can do around here for entertainment ?
Well , you have a community theater and you have Allegheny College nearby that brings in entertainment . If you have a car , you can go on one tank of gas and it 'll get you a lot of places and you can always go to Erie .
I 'm an advocate of the Market House , I 'm down there every day , sometimes more . I go up to the Gardner theater sometimes and enjoy the music and I like the atmosphere inside there and how it feels and all .
Yes , I was born here and I raised my family here , I own a house here and my children are still in town I guess we 're truthfully trying to get out , but we have n't made it yet ( laughing ) .
I guess it 's pretty much attitude ,
Its just like Trump says , we 're playing up too much negative news   - too much negative news in this town - we need to you , you know , give some credit where credit is due - it may not be a top story
I 'm not pushing religion , I 'm just saying that it is a lot of basis for a lot of community activities .
I was sitting here looking from my spot across at the top of the steps ( at LTI ) , and that was my spot when I went to school , that used to be a school .
We decided to take out the stop lights eleven years ago because they used too much electricity - we just took them out . - you tell me you ca n't buy electricity for a long time for $ 52,000 ?

Um , I love the people in Meadville .
My friends are okay , I guess haha .
We walk around and play around I guess . Ya . I do n’t know we do n’t really do anything we just walk around town .
Um , oh shoot this is a good one , my favorite memory would be like I do n’t know going around town with my friends and the um like Meadville has those littler carnival things going on in the summer . know what they are called .
I think that is Second Saturday .
Um , because it is just time spent with my friends and people around Meadville seeing what they do .
We have seen two ladies , um , wool I think it is , big things of wool and they spin it with their fingers and it goes through a big thing and they pedal it with their foot .
So , ya that ’s definitely second saturday .
The environment .
People taking care of it and it growing .
Um , because I have a lot of family and friends in Meadville .
I was born here .
Sometimes I am and sometimes I am not , because like my dad went to the high school and my family has kind of brought a bad name to our last name .
I like pizza villa because I worked there . Vocelli 's . PA sub shop , that is I like their pizza it ’s very good .
Like what we are doing here , type . I think just like in the summertime how you see like groups of kids interacting with each other and like hanging out and stuff . Kids outside of their house , not on their phones .
Um , walk around the diamond with my friends and we hang out at the parks and play basketball and play football .
Um , not really . I mean playing football and stuff like that we invite everybody so that ’s kind of meeting new people .
That ’s where me and my friends all meet up everyday and that ’s just kind of like in the middle of all of our houses and we just kind of walk around .
Because that ’s where you see a lot of kids playing and me and my friend joanna and my god daughter , we take my goddaughter there . And , she interacts with all the kids and stuff .
Just places you can go and do whatever you want and like a building where there is different areas in the building and you can do something .
Like there was a skate park inside there and an area where you could spray paint on the walls .
And , it was like in the back of an alley , in like a little abandoned area , garage thing .
Because um parents and stuff . I do n’t know my cousin and my best friend that lives in Florida we kind of made a deal that once she graduates and I graduate . I ’m going to pack everything up and move down to Florida .
You could totally do that , I mean I moved away too . You could totally do that , it ’s important . But say you did have kids here what would you want them to experience if they grew up here .
Like change all of the bad people and make them good .
Just to give you guys an incite into what people want is totally cool . I want to here like why , what kind of bad things you are talking about like I can imagine what you mean , but I want to know what you are thinking of .
Like there was a shooting by my house . Like a while ago and it would be cool if we could like prevent that from happening .
Um , create more things for young people to do um , and go places and stuff .

I I 'm going to ask you one more question . I guess so the only other question I have is what you would change , to make Meadville even better ?

The first thing you said about that bridge when I saw it was that was the exact type of attachment that Meadville has . Because it 's a bridge but it it 's beautiful and it shows your exactly what this place has to offer .
Every time we improve something it has a massive lasting effect on people .
I So what are some things you think still need to be improved on ?
and I would love to see more people want to do things like you 're doing . And like I said , the picnic thing thought that would be something that people really want .
I I 'm going to ask you one more question . I guess so the only other question I have is what you would change , to make Meadville even better ?

I So what are some things you think still need to be improved on ?
and I would love to see more people want to do things like you 're doing . And like I said , the picnic thing thought that would be something that people really want .
, I want it to keep going the same way it 's going , I do n't want it to slow down . I want it to just be pushing .
I So you wanna sustain that growth . You wanna make sure that 's sustainable . Yeah , for sure .
Whether by making sure our kids are informed and intelligible about those passions and stuff or it just by having events that people continue to be involved and whatever you know . Aside from like a mass shooting or some terrible natural disaster that 'll stop it .
I Yeah .
muffled enforcement things like that . ight but it 's not those things that like for hundreds of years it was additional negative . And when we need positive and good it 's transcendent .
I Is there anything else ?
People should improve their vocabularies . But that 's besides the point . laughs
I You know , community learning , that 's always important . I appreciate you sharing all this .
Oh , of course .
This is also , technically , my first interview with My Meadville but I also do n't want to miss this opportunity to tell you guys about stuff that you might be interested in .

I Yeah no and that would be awesome and you got connections and that would be great too . Because that ' something we 're looking at networks and whose connected to what group .
