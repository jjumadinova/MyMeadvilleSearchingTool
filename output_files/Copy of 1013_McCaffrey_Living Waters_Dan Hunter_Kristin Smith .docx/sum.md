**excerpts:**
It 's kind of hard to digest those three parts because thinking about Meadville -- it 's home . So it 's just part of who I am now at this point .
And we all have families and it 's very easy to have a family here because of the resources that we value . We know our kids are safe with other agencies and other groups and sports and other groups that they 're associated with .
It 's a great region to be in . so if you 're into outdoor stuff there 's a lot of things all season to do . There 's ,
We have state of the art medical facilities , we have high end colleges and education , opportunities , ya know , we have all of those pieces available if you get connected and seek it out .
The science center , we went to the aquarium in Cleveland for an overnight during the summer and it was beautiful . We went there we saw it I 'm like I 'm alright .. I 'll go there No ) .
I feel safe there .
Yeah , ya know we 're like right in the center .
I honestly think they know , but they do n't think about it or , ya know , you hear people break about Meadville , ya know , there 's nothing to do .
Oh I have a carpet cleaning business .
Auto repair .
It 's interesting because it 's a lot of what I 'm doing , and in the early childhood realm is trying to connect parents to resources for parents to be their child 's first teacher .

MOPS -- Mothers of Preschools .
Yeah , just from being an information hub and distributor . Intercity transiency between 23 and 25 % move from year to year . So creating some sort of access points , a lot of it happens on Facebook , a lot of it happens online .

Without that relationship they 're not going to be as open or wanting to listen or even accept help because without that relationship there 's a divide and a separation .
, somebody else promised me something and did n't do anything . And that 's just completely destroys the relationship and the trust and the everything . So when we say something , we have to do something .
ight , because like ya know , they have so many people who let them down , who have walked out of their lives , who have promised them things and did n't do anything and just and they are so used to that .
So we have to be aware of what 's available in town , what going places1316(indecipherable ) will do and different schools . So I need to be able to have a relationship in every direction that maintaining the family that I 'm working with .
So it 's building trust with the families and the people we want to get the information , but it 's also that next layer of ( other   what do we do with it ?
We are helping people , but we all need to know about that Those are the things people remember and that safety feature involved with trustworthy people , especially with you 're not letting them down because they are let down a lot .
And like Jeremiah 's example the little boy needed the tire , that 's a single mom situation . I do n't know how many guys she may have dated that made those false promises to this little six year old .
Kids are a product of their environment . If they 're not shown that you 're gon na keep promises and do what you say you 're gon na do , it becomes a way of life and it 's a ripple effect . It continues with their kids .
And their trauma .
Otherwise they 're just dangling .
Sources of trauma , yeah .
Their guardian , whoever 's in charge ..
They 're in fight or flight mode all the time and they 're often angry . They think I 'm gon na come in there judgey because I 'm the church lady .
So it 's not their fault , it 's really not .
It 's not . It 's a lot of circumstances .
They have what looked like a pop-up activity , it was n't like a BBQ or fundraiser , it was something for the community That was like in June or something I saw that . They were trying something .
So there are catholics , or methodists , or unitarians in a central place with a central goal to pray for the city and how great it can be .
Have you done any since then ?
There 's pastor breakfast and there 's , coming up soon , is another gathering for the pastors .
Do they do the outreach once they eat dinner or approach the community or ?
That 's the goal . But I do n't know , I 'm not privy to that I 'm not the pastor .
So because you could do a quick neighborhood thing , you have trust with a lot of those neighborhoods So it has to be over here , that neighborhood , this neighborhood , where we 're sitting now .
They 're different areas and that 's their unit There are various agencies in Meadville which help families with different things that may arise in their family life . There are so many different agencies .
Crawford county coordinating because there 's the LICC , local inter - agency coordinating council . There 's so many acronyms you get lost in the jargin . and it 's just getting everyone together for the common good .
For me it 's kids . I 'd only been at my location for a few months now that 's where my business is . It 's not the kids ' fault they are where they are .
Hey if you remember this lesson , we 'll get you a candy bar next week if you remember that . '
They either did a really good job or they did a really bad job You see the kids walk by your shop . ( other   there 's not a lot of parents walking them by ) .
It 's probably more moms , it would just depend . Sometimes the men come over because there are toys that occupy the child . I think it would be more of a toss up , it would depend on the day and the place .
Thank you Kristin for speaking up for the male race .
There are plenty of involved dads in certain community settings , and the places we 're going have been since we 're still building trust have not been the places where you guys are doing sidewalk church .
So what brings him ( Jeremiah ) is he 's going to be the male that he craved seeing , whether he saw that or not , he 's going to make that available to the town because some kids do n't have that
And the father / male example in kids ' lives , the daughters , the young women . The males that they see in their lives are the model of the male of their future husband .
We hope to disrupt the bad behaviors and set the example off . Not all are bad . Hopeful to disrupt the bad and just be the example whether it needs to be modeled or not .
We have families in those communities that there 's a man , there 's a woman and they do a great -- there 's a family that helps us with sidewalk at the one site . So there are good families .
There are also amazing fathers out there .
I really wanna hear what Dan 's answer is . You started an issue here buddy .
go back out , I do n't know what it is really . But if you did , maybe you had no real reason to do it , you had your own reason .
I ve never had a problem , not one problem .
And you 're not gon na .
In that area , I 've never had anything messed with . I ve had kids come like see my mechanics pushing a car like a fourth grader will go behind the car and push it .
Yeah , that 's what 's really happening there . It 's not just dangerous zones .
Yeah , we have normal kids that I do n't know their names but every time they walk by I get a smile or a wave .
Where I work , where my business is .
I mean what drawn me , I think you guys are the voices . I 'm not . But i just think small business can contribute to , to make it better . Not commercially or anything like that , but to reach more people .
Yeah , whether it 's with taxes or doing a block party and getting that community togetherness .
So here are some books .
So if you take the ten minutes as a male who knows how to use these tools appropriately and read them this page of the book and teach you sockets . Or read this page of the book and teach you wrenches .
I guess sometimes I get tunnel vision .
ight , but your kids know how to use most of those tools appropriately , correct ?
Half of them .
Boys side or the girls side ?
Okay , but realistically the kids walking by your shop every day , I do n't know how many tools are in their houses or someone has sat them down to show even basic , this is a phillips head versus a flat head .
ight , when they have to change a tire .
You were taught , your dad taught you . And maybe that s the way to get a local place that happens to make wrenches and things Here , these are for the kids . You did n't know you were getting a new job tonight , did you ?
And that 's a trade around here that s vital to the community . That 's a good industry .
I 'm like ' oh my ... it 's over ' . But it was a real pain in the butt .
At the Vernon Place ? Was that the meeting ?
Oh the municipal church . I remember .
I must have been excited .
We were above the market house and i wanted to do the pop-up in my parking lot , but i wanted to do it at night because i wanted to do night time activities . so what , it was a beautiful , wicked fun time that night .
that was hours of free entertainment for every level of family , regardless .
Look at all the businesses that come together , it costs them money to participate . It 's shocking how many business will jump on board with a concert or a community event , or whatever .
It costs money to be in that event if you 're not a non - profit .
And to build the floats and the car .
And all the money raised to a local beneficiary . And that changes each year , the local beneficiary .
I think more businesses would be on board to contribute .
, it was like the definition of a pop-up . ' I do pop-up preschools . Autumn Vogel was there , and she did a pop-up art installation , we 're all doing these pop-up things . And it 's beautiful .
But like before that block party , I had never heard of the Going Places project . Maybe everyone 's coming to Dilman 's but then get the Going Places project and Living Waters out there too .
To couple them with things that people are already doing .
And get your services and whatnot , not promoted but pushed out there , so the public knows more about it .
And knows that you as a business owner , you were there sponsoring the event . And you were not looking for personal gain , you were looking for the event , but it still was there at your spot .
Even if it was raining this time , the rain did n't stop anything .
But what we could do as business people , we can do all of that , we are our own board from payroll to washing the toilet .
I was seeing people , I do n't know where I was just at .
We see families all over town , and kids will run up to us , especially if we 're wearing a designated shirt and they 're like ' Miss Jenn ! ' But we have kids like flock to us in Walmart , or the parade we were all watching and were like ' that 's my kid , that 's my kid ' , we were claiming hundreds of kids .
They do n't follow you , you follow them .
Literally we had a newborn baby born last week , three pounds , and one of the first text messages dad do you need transportation for medical appointments ? you have a brand new baby , are you prepared for this ? ' .
we are definitely the sighting , like people say to you like ' oh yeah you 're the Pumpkin Derby guy , you 're that guy ' .
And she was like ' I mean Jen from street church ' . I got a text message because everyone has my phone number for bus ministry , if they need their kids picked up
Yeah , that 's a small barrier in this town .
Oh , I think its nonexistent honestly .
I mean there could be , but its very narrow .
And I wanted the Chamber of Commerce to notice me , I wanted the bigger guys , like Acutec , to notice me because how easy these little people and you guys are doing nothing but charging for every damn golf tournament , and you ask me for something to give away . Anybody , Mike 's a few months in , but what a wonderful ' Hello , here I am ! ' for Mike . And I did n't realize you were moved in until Facebook . ' And all this was generated in a few days , whatever you wanna call it .
My boys the night before . They all did it and then they came on Saturday and they live in Titusville .

My program Going Places is a partnership between Meadville Children 's Center , Crawford Central School District , and Laurel Technical Institute . So Laurel Technical Institute has an early childhood education program . Those early childhood education program people who are going to get their CDA , they come and help us at our events and get field experience with our kids .
Twice a month somewhere , either there or there , twice a month , and then we get10002
And that 's the plan . So now that we 're recognized enough to go , to start going . Its breaking down those silos and putting down little tiny bridges in between . It 's starting to come together .
Some parents choose get on , they willingly get on a bus , and they ride a bus for an hour to go to a church service and they ride the bus home . So 60 wiggly kids on a school bus .
