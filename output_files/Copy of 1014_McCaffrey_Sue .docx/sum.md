**excerpts:**
When I mail my bills , I walk them . I walk my bills . I go across the street and pay my water bill . and I pay a bill .
Well , I still go to local sporting events , ya know ? On the high school level . I 'm all for prorgress- downtown progress , community progress . ya know , new bridge , this , that- I 'm a Meadville man .
Uh , the people that come into my business , I know them on a personal basis . It 's just a quaint little community . I 've moved away before , but I always like to come back to Meadville .
My friends . I mean , my acquaintances . Let 's be clear . My acquaintances . Not so much my friends , but my acquaintances . The smallness of it , the camaraderie .
Same people that take tickets , same people that coach And it 's not on a real personal level but your'e acquainted with these people . I might go to Oil City or Franklin or Greenville and I know a lot of people there .
It 's .. I sometimes long for a city atmosphere . But once I 'm in the city for a while ... it 's just different . I lived in Miami for a while .. Ya know , everybody 's looking at their shoes .
I mean specifically ?
You mean downtown people ?
I 'm not crazy about parking tickets . Mainly the second floors .. see some development in second floor whatever . If you go downtown , you just see first floor . We 're second floor down here . We 're second and third floor .
It 's gotten better . I mean there 's some go-getters down there like Bill next door and some of these guys that are really good at developing ideas . I mean he took over the old post office , ya know ? He made that prosper .
The Mercatoris building , where 's that ?
Oh okay , where they used to have the self defense place downstairs ?
Oh yeah , that 's a beautiful building .
Oh you wo n't believe it when I showed at the end how big this is .. This is a big building . It 's got 11,000 square feet .
Well , it 's been a lot of work . You ca n't even imagine what we 've done in this place . Air condition , new lights , new track , clean . I mean , just developing floors , sanding , moving walls in and out .
And we do n't have to get wheelchair access because we 're grandfathered in . But we still have to pass fire codes . But as far as what you 're saying , a lot of , uh no . I 'm pretty much good with codes .
ya know , I was substitute school teaching and this kid kept saying to me we need another partner who0916(indecipherable ) . And then getting in it , and then it was terrible money , but it was a lot of satisfaction .
I like working ' . But I love to go to work , I love to see my friends , and I love to .. Boxing , like amateur boxing .
Women love it . Women love it because it 's hard work out and uh ..
Small town .
Not because we 're a college town . and ya know , he 's a big big football man , we argue every day . and he 's just a great person . The tv thing ? ' And he 's just a wonderful person .
Well , I 'm just being honest and I think every business person probably has their own little quirks . I mean if I was i would n't be in this business . But I 'm about excitement , I 'm about surviving .
I was all for it , I was for the expansion of North St. Ya know , you hear so much pessimism about downtown and smaller towns , but I would n't trade this little downtown for anything .
Yeah , and ya know I 'm the first one . If somebody comes back to Meadville that I 've known from before , they say ' this town looks terrible ' . I say ' on the contrary ,
Yeah , we got some decent restaurants , but most places do . But who has a state of the art movie theater like we do out there ? It 's got like ten theaters in it , and its just exciting , ya know ?
And the little one downtown is kinda hanging in there , and they 're making some moves to improve , ya know ? So , that 's all I can say .
So we 're done ?
