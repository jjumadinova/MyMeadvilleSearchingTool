**excerpts:**
I love all the community events like second Saturday where you can go and have fun with your friends or family , and I like all the locally owned shops such as creative crusts and tattered corners , and I like that there is not a lot of crime here
Um my favorite memory is in the summer I would go to the farmer ’s market with my parents and then we 'd go to creative crusts and get bread and we would have tons of fun .
My dad got a job here and so we moved here and I stayed because of my parents .
Having more places to hang out with my friends and more places to shop at .
The big zipper where all the people contributed pieces to it and all the road signs out by giant eagle .
Um , creative crusts because I go there practically every weekend and its , you can just sit there and talk or you can like eat its its really nice .
Um , its important to continue community events and uh having low crime rate .
To have more shopping options like build a better mall or expand the downtown mall to have more places that teenagers would like to shop at like H&M or like forever 21 or Hollister , places like that .

1 Was it hard to find the place ?
1 Uh I was born and raised here so I like it , you know . People ya know I get along with the people you know the ones I know , so ............
1 Get you to your appointments if ya need to go to an appointment .
1 Yup .
1 Uh , they ’re mostly , the ones I know are mostly friendly . Ya know everybody knows everybody around here . So its not really that big of a town , but , but everybody knows everybody , everybody gets along with everybody .
1 Its a friendly little town like like a Mayberry .
1 Friendly nice people you know you have have have to ask any question any directions you get the right person and they ’re show you right where it is .
but I before I lost my sight I used to go play basketball play softball , just stuff around with people .
1 Um I had um a disease called sarcoidosis and um it because came on my brain it went to my brain and um , it took my eye sight and my optic nerve .
1 I was able to see before but then I think I ’ve been blind four years now
1 Yea it jus came jus got married and and it was going good and then all of a sudden it took my sight so .
1 Yea basketball , baseball , football .
1 Oh yea I definitely miss it .
1 Yea runnin around with the fellas .
1 And now its like I you know I do n’t watch it on TV , I listen to it .
1 But I ’m starting to get the hang of it ya know you just got ta take it day by day the best I can .
1 Yea they they use like a ... When I go to a meeting they ’ll call me up and they ’ll send somebody up they ’ll call me tell me what time they ’re gunna come and them they ’ll come and get me .
1 Um keystone .
1 You was talkin to me ?
1 What did you say ?
1 How would I describe Meadville you sayin ?
1 Oh . Being able to get around I mean I been here all my life so I know most of the things and sights and people Ya know I ride the cat bus every while before I was blind so I know where my stops are and everything
and then the keystone line like You know charges and then we 'll pay them to take us down there . n’t like to drive in the big city anyways so .
1 Um ... Top wish . I wish just everybody could get along ya know . Ya know have that where you know ....
1 Yea everybody could get along .
1 But um yea Ya know with me not having my sight I see how things could be and how you are treated ( pause ) so .
1 Naw not really , I ca n’t say I really do . 'Cause I ’m that I ’m the type of person I get along with anybody so . Um . Naw I do n’t have no story about that .
1 Just growing up here was fun . Just Meadvilles a nice little old town .
1 Yea we we found stuff to do you know , go up to Allegheny college , play up there and play basketball up there and stuff on their courts . Now its like you ca n’t really do it , you know . They do n’t
1 You know like kids now gettin out like we used to . There used to be baseball fields you used to be able to go to play baseball all day . Stuff like that .
1 Ah ha yea that ’s right up the street .
1 Yea .
1 Oh yea I guess it would be an opportunity I just ai n’t been up there in so long . You know they got swimming in the rec and the ice skatin rink and the roller I think they got roller skating in the summertime .
1 Oh they do n’t . Oh ok see its how long its been .
1 Oh do they ?
1 Yea a skateboard park .
1 Yea . It used to be one over that hill , where rat lake is . They call it rat lake .
1 Yea we from Meadville too ?
1 Oh ok
1 Yea you get a lot of opportunities if you know the right people . There ’s a lot opportunities around here .
1 As far s going to school . Ya know get a nice education . They got a good school system . Um ( pause )
Just , for me it be my friends , 'cause I got a lot of friends . And since I ’ve been in this situation I ai n’t been around I ai
2 I ’ve lived here all my life , that ’s why it feels like home
1 I told them Meadvilles a lot of friendly people around here .
2 Its just a nice quiet calm town , I , this is the best pace to raise your children . It really is !
2 There is n’t much that ’s one thing that Meadville needs to do is they need to get something for our teens our pre - teen adults .
1 Keep them off the streets
2 There ’s nothing for them to do to keep them off the streets . I remember when I was younger , they had up y-teens , they had um , arcade places , they had um …
1 The parks used to be open in the summertime
They used to have summer parks , children go to the summer park do crafts , games , they do n’t have the no , College kids used to even go to the parks , and up they did a lot of crafts and stuff with the kids .
1 Elm   street .
2 Elm street .
1 Yea
2 And that ’s more like um they do school supplies stuff for the children , the needy children , and then they do a little carnival along with it . I think that ’s the only exciting thing Meadville has for out children .
2 What are those skates called ? Uh ..
2 No , the big long wood things ...
2 Skate , they have skating board up there . But , you got ta have this to be able to get in and enjoy that . You know , I I think Meadville needs to concentrate more on our children .
1 How long have I been blind , about four years ?
2 About five years .
1 Five years
2 Yea
1 Tell 'em you know I used to go to the basketball court the college and you know play basketball , baseball , used to have baseball fields , softball .
They wonder why the crime rate is getting high in Meadville , and it is , I mean I can remember when I was 15 years old I mean we were a close community , and now its like , there ’s ...
1 I told them it was like Mayberry
2 Yea mmhmm yea almost like Mayberry , but now you 've got a lot of people moving into Meadville um . and so therefore they 're robbing homes , um , drug trafficking , you know but I just think Meadville need stuff for our children .
3 You never thought about drugs ago in Meadville .
2 No ! !
3 But way back because they used to do they do n’t do that . But now they ’re out there on the street trying to bring people in . Kids in .
2 I I think that ’s the only complaint I have in Meadville , because the hospitality is very nice for Meadville .
1 Yea that ’s why I said it be like home .
2 Meadvilles beautiful , um …
1 Getting along with a lot of people .
2 ight , I I think that the main thing I do n’t like about Meadville .
A long long lime ago they had a segregation , but now that they broke up the segregation , and now they ’re hand in Where before in the years back there was . A long time ago like back , back in the 60s and the ...
2 But that was everywhere , that want just Meadville .
3 But then they got rid of it .
I think that my chief complaint in Meadville . Other than that I love Meadville . Um , but to wanna move somewhere now , I love Meadville its my home town .
1 Yea I would wanna be in Meadville you know the grandkids could get an education here .
2 Yea , there ’s just nothing for children here , nothin . Nothin at all . I think that would be the biggest thing I would want Meadville to work on is something for our children .
you could go up there to Shady Brook , Heidi Cooper , parks up by the school , a lot of parks , and    there ai n’t hardly any parks anymore and um they like I said um Allegheny had a lot of their students that would open up the parks and they would just have crafts and games , and I used to have to go drag my children home because they would be up there , I think that ’s my biggest problem .
2 Yea I think Allegheny has done , Allegheny students has done a lot , for our children , um like that ramp um for say that ramp um Allegheny students come down and built that ramp for my husband . If it was n't   for them building that ramp , it took us a good 20 minutes to get homer out of the house .
3 I ’m not quit sure I I ca n’t I ca n’t recall it
2 Um they help the handicapped   and the elder you now if the elder needed a roof done the Allegheny   students did that and ...
1 Habitat for Humanity ?
3 And they go in and they paint houses for people .
2 No ...
2 Um I do n’t know the name of it but they just they do , I , the only people that do a lot for our community is the Allegheny students , I must say if it was n’t for the Allegheny students
2 Yup , it , I , I I prop all the students up there , I truly do . They built my ramp for my husband .
Meadville tribune was here too I ’m crying I was so overwhelmed because I ’m like my god There was times where ...... 'Cause it was a burden to get him out of the house so …
2 Yea I think that ’s my , that ’s my main focus .
1 And they do n’t have no curfews now .
2 And you see all these young children and they just hang at country fair .
1 Yup .
2 Yea .
1 And they do n’t have curfews . Do they ...
2 What ’s that ?
1 They do n’t have curfews no more .
2 No they used to have curfews , they do n’t .
2 It says " how might we improve the strength of our community ? "
That ’s a really hard answer . n’t think we have a bad community . n’t think our community is not strong , because if there is somebody in need
2 I dunno .
3 A lot of older people are afraid to walk downtown . Nowadays compared to what it was last year .
I guess for your question where its says , " if you were in control of the cities budget , what would you improve ? I think again I think I would improve the funds for them to do stuff with our children . I can remember growing up ....
1 Transportation
3 Yea but I , I also would improve the the more more for the sidewalks for the blind people too .
2 They ’re doing that the ...
3 The sidewalks are bad and uh they need more improvement . Because if I was disa .. I ’m not disabled but I ca nt I would n’t be able to walk downtown I got one of those jazzys , which I got ta get a battery for yea
2 Yea the sidewalks are bad .
3 I do n’t think I could do that on the sidewalks with the jazzy ....
1 You got ta walk in the street .
3 They tried to take him downtown in the wheelchair ....
2 Actually you ’re right because I witness when I ’m working at the store ill see a lot of elderlys driving their jazzys in the road so …
3 Yea because the sidewalks ai n’t ai n’t ai n’t cape ... Or ai n’t good for them , jazzys or anything .
2 Yea we tried pushing him downtown in a wheelchair and its difficult
3 She could n’t get it through the uh rough parts of its cement of the uh ... Sidewalk
2 We had to pull him backwards .
3 And they , I think they need more room the sidewalks . For the blind and the elderly , I really do .
3 There ’s a lot of stuff that they need to do that uh they ...
3 Yea it one thing the blinded have the the canes they have the ball ; they would n’t be able to walk down there . Because the ball would get stuck in prolly one of these holes or ruts .
2 I think that ’s the only thing I have a problem in in Meadville I ’m not dishappy ...
3 I ’m not unhappy about Meadville , I like living here .
2 I love Meadville I love it here , um I just that ’s the main thing if I were to be able to do somethin I would focus on something for children , especially poverty children , and we have a lot that here . We really do .
3 I want to focus on I want for the blind to ...
2 Well yea , but I ’m saying I want for children too mom , there ’s a lot of them that hang on the streets and get in trouble and ...
3 I know I know and its not good for them ..
2 There ’s nothing for them to do .
2 eally ?
1 Is that bad ?
2 It never used to be like that either , like I said you could leave your doors unlocked at night and go to bed and sleep sound and knowing ....
3 I lock all my windows and doors .
’s car , but they robbed here car . Actually my grandson was having a sleepover and they were all camping out front before the ramp was built , and they were all had their sleeping bags stuff on the porch
3 I ’d be afraid to been outside .
2 I think that ’s the only , problem I have with Meadville . That I I must prop and I do n’t know where to go to prop you Allegheny students but you guys do a lot for our community .
1 Yea
2 Allegheny does do a lot for the community they really do . Many things . I ca n’t even think of all the stuff they do but .
2 That ’s wonderful there too yea . You know what , you ’re right , um , my brother goes every year and the the income tax Allegheny students help with income tax , do the income tax .
1 Yea at the library ?
2 I really do n’t have any more to add that ’s ...
that you know we need more stuff for children to do .
3 Your grandchildren ai n’t all grown up .
2 Well they ’re …
3 Antwon ai n’t and neither is Devante .
2 No I ’m talking about the ones that are n’t hanging on the street that have are able to go out by themselves and be able to do something .
3 ight .
2 The little ones ca nt , but that ’s my main focus I would wanna say is for the children .
1 Mmhmm .
2 Yea and what about , out summer days um when they used to have the sidewalk sales downtown . I mean , we we ’ve got businesses .
3 There ai n’t no down town anymore .
2 We do have businesses downtown .
3 Not a whole lot .
They used to all get together ’d look forward that it would be the whole weekend and they would have a little carnival and stuff like that down there , um , and I ca nt remember what it was called , but it was always in , august …
They had the diamond park closed off for our teens and had bands going up there They do n’t do that anymore , you do n’t see no downtown sidewalks anymore , no carnivals downtown …
1 Nothin .
2 Nothin . Sometimes you wonder if Meadvilles becoming a ghost town …
Chelsea Lee Tucker
Um , it its a place where you can get help for mental illness .
And they also give you shelter for homelessness .
Um , I think that ’s about it .
No , just since before Christmas for like two days .
I think so yea .
Um , the help .
Mmmm , the people .
They ’re nice .
No nothing .
CVS , Walgreens , uh , the mall .
And um the read program .
Hush . I ’m not quite sure .
I want go there .
It is . I want to um read better , do math better , do social studies and science better .
It will help me pass exam like the SATs and the uh exam to get into college .
I ’m thinking about going for CNA to help be an N.
Well , um , I saved two people in my lifetime , and I liked doing it so ...
Well my sister was drowning in a swimming pool . Uh , this guy I brought home ended up with a car that fell on top of him ...
Um , they help you to learn how to live independently .
The help .
Um , learning to live independently .
The confusion of walking around .
Having somebody who can walk around with me .
Everything being in like the same block .
Um . I made some good friends here .
Um no that ’s it .
