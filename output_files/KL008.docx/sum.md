**excerpts:**
I like the fact that it seems like a small town , even thought its on the big side . People are very friendly .
Well , people open doors for you and people stop and let you cross the street .
Most of my favorite times are up here at CHAPS .
I love their holiday parties .
Christmas mostly .
Yeah , up on andolph Street
Well let 's just say that I left Conneautville not of my own choice
Like they have the mental health fair go on there , I think it was called the Second Saturday or something .
CATA bus . I have my own issues with them .
As long as they keep the sense of community .
I think getting involved with the community health fair-like at the Diamond or at the Mall
It seems pretty good , but like my issue with CATA bus is that in the winter time , their bus stops usually kept clear so its hard to catch the bus and they could use an extra bench or two here and there .
I think everything 's pretty good the way it is .
I ca n't think of anything right off hand ... I guess the only thing I would wish for is just more job opportunities sometimes - you know like everytime you see things in the paper , you need some kind of technical degree or something .
Well , like I said I 've been here about 3 years , and I 've really come to like it .
