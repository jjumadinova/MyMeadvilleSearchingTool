**excerpts:**
Sounds like a good idea .
I ’ve been a lot of different places in my life , but I do n’t really like the heat uh , so anywhere south of here would be a bad idea for me . But also I know the whole community , pretty much .
I think it ’s probably just the people that I ’ve known my whole life that do , that have come back here .
Good , when I was younger I played a lot of sports , I had a lot of friends , so I did pretty well in school . Umm .
But , yeah lot of too much fun in my teen years .
there are those kinds of things and there 's also , um , you know a lot of different walks and things they do downtown that bring a lot of business to the downtown stores and things like that .
And you know there is annual stuff , I 'm not excited about pushing him in a car seat or in a stroller this year at all . and you know like Thurston classic and everything else , that will be really fun .
Why do you like those types of things , like the vet thing ?
They give you adaptable things , they can help you install adaptable shower systems . So these people can take a shower and still live at home .
Were always finding ways to make it fun too , like there is a side activity happening like a dart game or golf or something . , you know mess around for fun , there is like an underlying good cause to it .
I do them probably on a month or bimonthly basis , but definitely when the weather is better we have better turn outs for different things .
I like harassing local vendors to offer you know , prizes for people to donate even more money so for instance , uh , you know , in Conneaut lake . Antonio 's donated a twenty five dollar gift card to auction off .
You know , like calling them , you know on the phone , asking them to donate . Do you want to come to this , do you want to support this ?
No , well yes . and I 'm pretty sure the Meadville PD . I would just make a couple phone calls , make sure I followed up . but they bought those tickets and
but yeah I 'd say that it 's a huge thing for my group , age group twenty five maybe and above that they do like to do that as a social , it 's their social time and
" And if we are friends and they are n't doing anything that day they buy a ticket and come .
I know that we had a lot of different things happen when I was younger that gave Meadville some attention . and she was like one of the youngest people whatever distance I ca n't remember the specifics but it got a lot of national attention here .
But yeah there were definitely things that gave us like some national attention , especially back when I was younger that I remember were really cool . Or maybe not just specifically like that but something with positive attention .
And I know that the high school athletics have been really good lately , gotten us a lot of positive attention which is great .
I know that in high school our journalism group that we had for writing in the school newspaper when I was a sophomore and Junior was really interesting . We were covering a presidential election and it was a big deal for us .
Yeah it was like a pageant thing , like I was not in it . And it was like a huge deal because we were all like fifteen and sixteen years old and they were all in it at once and the whole community was pretty much there .
Some want to do it and they keep wanting to do it until they are fifteen or sixteen and they are like I never want to do that . Or they just never want to be on a stage . That 's not me
Why did I want to do that ? Actually , uh to be honest one hundred percent on that I went to , I joined the military right after 9/11 I had six months of college under my belt And I was gone until I was twenty one .
I left for my initial like gear up for training , I had to drop out of college in November of 2003 and I did n't come back until February of 2006 .
Nineteen to twenty one I was like just turning twenty and then I was just turning twenty one when I came back . So my whole twenty to twenty first year .
Well I finished school but I was n't having the best time at life .
And my mom was here and she was n't having the greatest time at life either , and
No it 's definitely not there are definitely people way above me that are management . But I do supervise people directly . And I mainly supervise the lives of because I do n't really supervise , I supervise my staff .
Well I was going through trouble too so I just wanted to be with my mom .
yeah , it 's there you know . There is no reason if you are n't doing anything else even if it does n't meet your expectations maybe some day it will meet other expectations .
And I had a son , and It 's debatable to say whether or not I have great health insurance , but I have good health insurance and for me
It 's a neurological disease that eventually will leave me to be probably eventually severely physically disabled .. But um yeah , having health insurance is very important , and I have been good health insurance .
I do n’t know it my personality would fit the “ for-profit ” industry anymore .
like if my personality would fit the “ go , go , go ” of a for-profit industry .
No we do n’t It ’s a huge thing for us .
And like I said , my mom works there
We used ot have Conneaut Lake park events or train ride at Titusville events and my mother would be like “ Lindsay , we ’re going to Conneaut Lake park ! ” then we ’d go and it would be a work event
And then so staff and our special services are going to be there ’re like , “ oh by the way , you can bring your kids ” and I ’m like ..

Yeah it ’s really good It ’s nice .
There ’s always the same fair .
And I think that the tourism in Meadville , it ’s small tourism
And it would be the same way for our fairgrounds or for here , like if there were any ideas that it would go away , it would mobilize people to make sure to do anything that could happen to keep it here .
I mean like to see them get bigger and better
No , absolutely not .

On the outskirts of Meadville , it ’s a big deal . That 's the thing , managing expectations that something big would come into meadville because we really do


And when we are in bad weather , we are rough , we are . ’re I would be really iT ’s long to be in but is really fun , we ’re a short hike away from it
Like , not minimum wage jobs , we have a ton of those . I know several people that have 2 or 3 jobs at a time
i ’m pretty sure they do n’t ask at all , and if they do it ’s in the Tribune as a poll and you only have the people that read the Tribune that participate .   Not hating on the Tribune at all , and they   have a ’s pretty   much it .
