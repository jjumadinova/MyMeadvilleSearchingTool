**excerpts:**
Big town feel . Small town living .
It provides me with all the services that I need because its big enough population wise but small enough that I do n't have to worry about not knowing my neighbors personally .
24 hour shopping .
None of its volunteer .
Low crime .
Pause …   I do n't know if I have a favorite memory .
I like going to the downtown Meadville Days in the summer whatever they 're called .
My job .
I work for Warner Kline Machine out of Erie Pennsylvania .   I transferred down here because the person running the Crawford County Office , um , got a much better job so I was able to jump up the company ladder , really fast really far simply by taking the position in Crawford County rather than staying in the city of Erie .
Again , small town feel with bigger town amenities .
That ’s what would make it easier .
I do n't want the city government looking over my shoulder on everything I do on my private property .
No not really . I would hope that being a smaller town that they would n't create laws in a politically correct vein just to satisfy their image .
What things ?
I can go anywhere in this country and say the word Channel Lock and everybody knows what I 'm talking about and that ’s all here .
What would I miss ?
Channel Lock
The manufacturing base here , the design base .
Umm , to attract more manufacturing and maybe less service oriented jobs .
Um , self-reliance , self-sufficiency .
Primary education .
I would say they provide a good , I would n't say they provide an excellent or outstanding , its good .
Um , allocating resources to students can actually benefit from it .
Those need more money .
The weather
Do you mean , I do n't know , Meadville 's Government to make it better ? Or ...
That they spend their tax revenue wisely and not on silly things .
I would much rather have Liberty Street paved .
