**sum:**
**excerpts:**
I sense that there is a good community of agencies that help other people in every aspect of life - and I think Meadville is a nice size town for family oriented kind of things - not too big or too spread apart everything is right here together .
I guess the sense of unity in the community
uh , like agencies and events are coordinating together and working together to provide I guess a nice set of activities - they 're courteous to each other
uh , I did n't actually grow up in Meadville , but my children did , and they made good friends here
mmhmm - and love the hot air balloons
um employment brought my husband and I here and we just lived here for a long time , so its home .
The Market House is one thing that really values what the town meant and how it is now .
Well , so they have a variety of activities there as well as events and community gatherings
Um , a lot of the history - like the zipper was invented here , and how its recognized with beauty with the gardens and stuff like that
The collaboration between agencies and activities and
That 's a hard question ...
Like the routine things that happen , like the activities or events like the hot air balloons or the Memorial services and um and the car show downtown kind of thing .
Well they do n't live here , but I would hope that they would get to see the hot air balloons and that - I 'm stuck on hot air balloons .
To see the value of what we have-and different perspectives I guess .
I guess what I mean is that people do n't see the work behind the scenes - people making stuff happen and getting people more involved .
hmm , I have n't really thought about that - I guess , try to help them understand the value of it - I know it 's hard to get volunteers and that people are busy and working and
make a wish ... that 's a tough one ... to continue to improve what we have and promote what we have more I guess -
my mind 's a little blank , I guess
