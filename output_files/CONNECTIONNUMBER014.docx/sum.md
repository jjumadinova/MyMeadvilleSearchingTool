**excerpts:**
I love all the community events like second Saturday where you can go and have fun with your friends or family , and I like all the locally owned shops such as creative crusts and tattered corners , and I like that there is not a lot of crime here
Um my favorite memory is in the summer I would go to the farmer ’s market with my parents and then we 'd go to creative crusts and get bread and we would have tons of fun .
My dad got a job here and so we moved here and I stayed because of my parents .
Having more places to hang out with my friends and more places to shop at .
The big zipper where all the people contributed pieces to it and all the road signs out by giant eagle .
Um , creative crusts because I go there practically every weekend and its , you can just sit there and talk or you can like eat its its really nice .
Um , its important to continue community events and uh having low crime rate .
To have more shopping options like build a better mall or expand the downtown mall to have more places that teenagers would like to shop at like H&M or like forever 21 or Hollister , places like that .
