**excerpts:**
Merit , I think the balloon festival , I think that 's when you think of Meadville something that you always , think about , and I know that 's something that we 've always gone to . That would probably be the one thing that comes to mind .
It 's something unique and different that you ca n't find in other areas .
Well I guess watch the balloons . laughs
We 're boring .
Um ... the small community atmosphere , I think that 's I mean we 're Cochranton there is because of the community and um , Meadville 's the big city laughs when your in Cochranton
Safe environment .
Uh , nice place to raise family .
I think for the most part . I think it 's changed over the years but now you here all the different stories of things that happen so you , are a little bit more hesitant .
Well um ... like the up at Walmart , they just had that incident where the lady was gettin ' followed around and , again just different .
Creepier things that never used to happen 25 years ago laughs . And there seems to be more violence in the community than there was 25 years ago .
I 've been in Cochranton my whole life ,
and then , I worked in Meadville ... College I worked in Meadville , Um , I 've been in Venango County the last five years but , other than that I 've basically always worked in the Meadville area .
Closeness to home . Um you ca n't find anything much more closer than laughs . Especially in Cochranton there 's not much , not many jobs .
So , I 'm in Meadville .
The same reason you know it 's close , um you know it 's a quick easy drive and the jobs are decent so , why go anywhere else I guess .
We do shopping . Again there 's not many options in Cochranton so we when you need something you end up running to Meadville . And it 's not that bad of a , you know fifteen minutes and you 're there .
so we do n't you know um , we 've got a movie theater in town now so we do n't use the theater to much in here . Uh we used to go to the rec complex , so ...
Uh more children activities and events . But it would be nice if there was more opportunities for them . Um , there 's so many opportunities for dance and gymnastics and that stuff but it all comes with a hefty fee too .
Um ... just like little I do n't know like activity days type thing , different things like that .
I think those are nice events , and the downtown mall . they did a few years ago did it , a um like multicultural event , and they had different stations set up in the downtown mall and you could go and do activities at each one
Where there 's different activities for the kids to do .
yeah it 'd be nice to have some kinda ... dance program or something that did n't cost so much you know laughs .
Mm hm .
Um , we 've done the dance , and payed and arm and a leg laughs .
Um ... the Y , does a lot of nice programs we 've done a lot of the Y programs we 've done the gymnastics and the tee ball and the soccer because they 're short term
Or is like , the sporting teams the tee ball like , through the little leagues are more , so yeah we 've done   the Y programs we 're pretty happy with those .
yeah and the emphasis on the child having a good time and enjoying it not , being pressured to always be the winner .
I do n't know if i would know that , especially I mean if you grew up here and went to school here and stuff , probably have a different ... I mean I could tell you that about Cochranton , you know .
And they 're always pretty good about donating stuff , different places I worked
Um , gosh I 've done a whole array of stuff ,
I mean just from getting Chinese auction donations for church , to um , doing like annual fun type projects so , I do n't know the whole way , the whole spectrum .
Yeah , you get tired of asking but ...
I 'm sure they get tired of being asked at the same time .
Well I think some of the bigger , like dads and channel lock like if they pulled out I think it definitely would affect the community just because of how many people they employ .
Um pause mm pause .
Yeah , yeah some channel lock people , and I think like , especially both of those are well known companies ,
That are in Meadville so that 's kinda like a signature , or branding type
You know that 's Meadville type ...
I blacked out , yeah I think those would , I think they would affect if either one of those companies pulled out .
I think that this My Meadville project and the different things that have spun from that um , are important like even with , what is it Dan Hunter , doin' those rose huts and things laughs but similar things like that that got people excited .
Probably because , they 're probably lookin ' for something free too laughs .
But , I mean it got them out in the community and it was a great move on his part for promoting his business too I mean they were all lookin ' on Facebook waiting for him .
So , I just think it was a neat , neat idea that he came up with .
Mm hm . We used to when they he was in Cochranton one time we ,
We , we went out and ... I mean it was a neat little scavenger hunt too .
I 'll have to convince him to go to Cochranton again laughs .
No not right now .

Oh boy .
I think it 'd be nice to see indiscernible I mean there was a while where the down town was just kinda , abandoned type thing .
but , I always think that would be nice if we had some sort of bigger department stores and stuff that you typically have to run to Erie for .
Yeah , for Hermitage or Butler .
Um , just cause like , places like Sam 's Club , you can only get so much at Walmart laughs .
So , and even like the department stores and that kinda stuff , again Walmart has its limits .
Or you end up going on Amazon .
Mm hm .
Well like you used to go down to chestnut street and there was so many empty places and um , park avenue ... and it just seems like some of those store and businesses   are getting revitalized and um , some of the activities that are happening like the second Saturdays at the Market House and um , do n't they do that band thing too ?
they did it on top of a , what was it a garage ...
Yeah yeah I mean they 're doing more activities to get people to come downtown and I think that 's pretty important .
It 's almost like two little mini towns for our new township and then downtown .
Um , cause so much for years was growing in Vernon township and like , your grocery , just bigger grocery stores and mean you could very feasibly have to do everything in Vernon township and never set foot in downtown .
Yeah , cause it 's not typically like I do n't , shop downtown unless I 'm looking for something specific .
Um pause . Well I guess you got Tops , I guess some of those bigger department stores . But where in the world would you put it you know laughs . So ...
No I think that 's pretty good .
Thank you , I 'm glad you were able to come in and
