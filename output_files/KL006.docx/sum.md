Well , it has a lot close by so that you do n't have to do too much driving around . Um that 's all I can think of .
Um I do n't really know this town and I 've always lived out in the country and this is really the only time I spent in a bigger town in my whole entire life , so I do n't know much about this town .
It was family situation that I kind of do n't really want to get into .
Well , the town mainly , back in the 80s , because my grandparents were farmers , so we used to bring our grains and wool to the old feed mill and stuff , so I always been on the cultural farming part of the history
Mainly wool from the sheep - we pretty much had a beef farm .
That 's a hard one because I do n't really know the town or things like that .
I am pretty much a regular there during the summer time .
Like old town-sticking to their roots , sticking to tradition , remembering and learning from the past to try to make things better for the future and the present .
Figure out what worked and what did n't so that you could make sure that was still there for the future .
Hmmm , I really do n't have any comment .


Yeah , and you try to explain it , and if they have n't been there and done , they might have their idea - but you know what the truth is , and trying to explain the truth to an outsider is extremely hard .
