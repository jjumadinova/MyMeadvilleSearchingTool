**excerpts:**
The summer is the best part . And really that kind of plays into the fact that pretty much about anywhere in town you are about 5 minutes away from being almost in the middle of nowhere . The summer times lends itself to spending more time outside .
what 's really nice is - so there are about three ravines So they are doing more tree management up there There are a couple of Beech trees up at obertson that are pretty big - they 're probably like 60 , 70 years old .
Not necessarily solo activities but small groups maybe 4 or 5 people - But usually its either by myself or with one other person - they 're like getaways .
The city of Meadville itself has got the things that you need -like grocery stores , laundry mats , pharmacies , whatever . um 90 minutes south you got Pittsburgh about 2 hours west
And What so cool about that is the water that 's up in Minnesota in like lake Superior does eventually filter down and come into lake Erie . So Its really one giant fresh water way which is really cool and like
Not polluting it , not abusing - just making sure that it is - that continues to be the resource that we want it to be - you know natural resource .
You know French Creek - when I drove out to Chataqua ,   I crossed the french creek and whoo   - the waterway again is just an immense ecological system . How do you think that we are as a local entity managing our water resources ?
I think you can look at it a few different ways.so , When I think of french creek I think of french creek conservancy -
You know lately there 's the big talk about The Meadville water source where we get out water from .
I think there 's 3 major wells that they pump water out of . you know really accessible water not that far down . One of the big conversations right now , is like well how do we manage the water source ?
Its not really the city because the city does n't have water authority , I don if the entity that manages the water supply is a for profit - I imagine that it is .
- she grew up there , went to high school , went to college , and then she got a job at the Iroquois club She was the manager of the Iroquois Club back in like the early 80s late 70s .  
On Arch so its kind of the funny area where chestnut splits off and turns in to alden so I Grew up there-after high school left and then 4 years ago moved back .
After high school I did a year at Juniata College in Central PA , then I dropped out , and then I moved to Colorado for a bit- So both my parents were First generation college students , so it was important for kids to go to college too . I went to Denison University in Ohio , was there for 3 years , got my degree then moved to detroit MI . I was there for 2 and a   half years roughly , then i moved back here .
So-  in the meantime i had gone down to panama was living with   a college roommate of mine who was doing like Peace Corps . so I Started doing promotional videos , and one of the promotional videos was for Voodoo Brewery . like hey let me make make some videos for you guys and they 're and it 's like a week before the event .
Yeah - there were so many people , there was so much food , and I think at the time all they had was-a refrigerator , a steel table , two hot plates , and a big steam kettle and that was it - , it was pretty nuts .
No , they have it all around , they are a fairly new thing , but as the craft brew industry has grown , they 've become more popular , but yeah any of your more successful breweries do these barrel-room releases and basically what it is

You would always hear these arguments like Voodoo , its so expensive , or I do n't like that beer it tastes like whatever - and you typically think of that as kind of being a long kind of class divides . You would have guys and groups of people coming over from CNJ Industries , from SecoWarick , you know , you fundamental laborers would come into Voodoo and enjoy the beer , but then you would also have you know the people who owned those businesses - the people who owned these multi - million dollar industries in town . And then because it 's so new - and
I do n't know if they highlight different beers at different locations or if they have a special beer based on those locations , I do n't think so .
Oh , definitely , they 're a beer on the national stage - they win national awards , they 're arguably one of the breweries in the country - yeah
So in Voodoo you saw this cross section of people getting along together sharing different views of the world , are there any other venues in the city where you see that happening ?


So I went to East End elementary school for a while , and I grew up walking to that school
I would like to see more sports leagues , like there 's a new volleyball club or volleyball group and they 've got these sand courts over at 5th ward
And I think games were like 7 minutes , so you would play 3 on 3 for 7 minutes take a break , play another game - they were amazing and they were such a huge event .
I was just knocked down , I started getting sick Thursday , and then Friday I 'm like man and Saturday I was like I was garbage - and then this Saturday out at Conneaut Lake is the ice house fest , similar concept ,
And they do happen , I think one of the most challenging things is communicating with other people that it 's going on - um we do n't have a singular news source that informs people of all the different events - Meadville Calendar is one , um you know the Tribune does an alright job of getting stuff publicized , but only if you send it in-very rarely are they doing outreach about it .
I think the EAD program is a great addition to the area - the robotics program in Meadville is super cool - you know having more stuff like that would be really advantageous .
But I think we have seen so many people who want to do stuff and want to get involved , but they do n't necessarily know what else is going on or what the timeline is or what groups exist
