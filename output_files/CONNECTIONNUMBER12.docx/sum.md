That 's a lot of things . So something that happened here regularly that reflects on why you like living here . I like the school systems .
That pause they 're into their students . I mean they 're there for them , when they 're struggling , they 're there for them . And I think that 's why my son is gon na be a successful person . Is because of these school systems .
The schools .
I would n't mind raising him in Pittsburgh if they had these school systems .
The people .
They 're friendly ... personable , I got great neighbors they laugh it 's true .
That 's it throw that in there . laughs
No , but I-
I am aware of the light of night .
yeah , seasonal ones , especially Christmas
That 's something that Pittsburgh , they have it but the town 's so big .
A lot more help for the people that need it in Meadville .
yeah , that 's true too .
It would be more stores . I do n't like Erie laughs
fixing up the old homes , the eyesores .
