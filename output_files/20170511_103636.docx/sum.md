**excerpts:**
I love all the fun things you can do with friends and family and all the activities you can participate in , and I feel it 's like a strong little community . That we all work together and have fun .
What matters to me most is my friends here . Because I feel friends ( and a lot of my family is here too ) , friends and family are a very important thing in your life .
My favorite memory about living in Meadville is probably playing baseball and doing all these fun games at baseball .
Some stuff to make living here easier would be cutting taxes , creating more jobs , and making it so we 're more of a more strong economic ... economy .
Probably all the history we have , because our history dates clear back to the 1700s . And there 's just so many things you can do like the Baldwin eynolds House , and even Diamond Park is history .
Probably if everybody just left that were my friends it would make me miss Meadville . Like if all the activities were gone like bowling and putt-putt it would not be Meadville anymore .
Probably strong friendships and the fair . The fair creates lots of money for us and its a fun activity too that needs to keep on going as a tradition .
I want them to experience all the things you can do like bowling and like even some of the restaurants like Eddies and Casey 's . They need to experience that local charm .
My one wish for Meadville would be to make all the houses look nice .
