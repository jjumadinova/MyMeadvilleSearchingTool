Yeah . And in the winter , I 'm off doing other things so
I would say that if there 's an event , it 's nice that it 's a small enough community that you can read about it in the paper I like the small community feel , And with the MCA , I like when they offer shows and stuff there . And i think the market house is a real asset to this community .
It was Uma 's . Uma was doing an Indian cooking class . But it 's just , it was n't really advertised well . And I ran into her at light up night and then I totally forgot .
But I love what the market house has to offer , cooking classes , second saturdays , and the MCA .
That was a big reason for it . And I 've been able to stay because I 've had a lot of interesting opportunities come my way . There 's definitely ways to get involved . Family is really the reason for that .
I love how Voodoo has actually bought one , and is potentially going to open it up so we can see that brewing process . I love that those spaces are still there . I love how affected the community was by the dismantling of the Talon factory .
Oh my gosh , the Market House . That would be , I do n't even know what i would do without the Market House . I mean I could tell you a couple things I could go without , but the Market House is essential .
I 'm sure a lot of people say that . It 's like one of the key things .
Well I think that one of the things is we really need to invest in our small businesses .
