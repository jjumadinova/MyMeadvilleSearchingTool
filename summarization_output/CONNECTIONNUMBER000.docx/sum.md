**sum:**
**excerpts:**
I like how it ’s like , very community based , and that you basically know like everyone , and everybody supports everything .
Probably the community again ‘ cause it ’s like , very welcoming to people .
Probably like , all of the parades that we have and stuff , it ’s just like , a tradition that we ’ve always had in a small town .
Um , my family and the family business that we have in Meadville . And I stay because I ’m not old enough to move alone , outside of the city yet .
Probably like , like if the downtown had more like fun shops that people could go to ‘ cause a lot of it now ’s like , run down like , businesses sometimes but , I think if we like up , the town , a little bit .


Probably the historic stuff all over town like you go downtown and you see like these signs saying like , who was here like , with the french , with french creek and stuff .
The historic and like , side of the town and like keep like , informing like younger kids about it , and then the smaller businesses and make sure they ’re like , thriving and not have like huge department store come in and like , take them out .
A good community . And having the experiences that like , I ’ve had in Meadville .
A smoothie place , I think that would be so much fun to have like , a place where teenagers can go and stuff like I think it would be a large attraction .
