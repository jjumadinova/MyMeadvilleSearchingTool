I feel like people here are the kind that would really pull together to help one another in times of emergency .
That ’s important to me .

I loved shopping with my mom as a child I suppose it only went up one floor , but it was a big deal .
My dad showed some of his art upstairs in the art gallery – it just is a special place for me .

You used to be able to find anything and everything here shopping-wise .
I ’m guessing it has to do with the youth I see who seem to be doing things and making things happen – I hope there are more things for them to do where they have to look people in the eye and talk !
great – lots of kids went and it was fun . Sometimes they had dance contests – I think it was out Baldwin St extension somewhere .
The Market House for sure .
The sense of community .
It would be great to get back to having people shopping in Meadville and hanging out here in town .
