**excerpts:**
I like the small town atmosphere and I enjoy some of the things you can do around here for entertainment ?
Well , you have a community theater and you have Allegheny College nearby that brings in entertainment . If you have a car , you can go on one tank of gas and it 'll get you a lot of places and you can always go to Erie .
I 'm an advocate of the Market House , I 'm down there every day , sometimes more . I go up to the Gardner theater sometimes and enjoy the music and I like the atmosphere inside there and how it feels and all .
Yes , I was born here and I raised my family here , I own a house here and my children are still in town I guess we 're truthfully trying to get out , but we have n't made it yet ( laughing ) .
I guess it 's pretty much attitude ,
Its just like Trump says , we 're playing up too much negative news   - too much negative news in this town - we need to you , you know , give some credit where credit is due - it may not be a top story
I 'm not pushing religion , I 'm just saying that it is a lot of basis for a lot of community activities .
I was sitting here looking from my spot across at the top of the steps ( at LTI ) , and that was my spot when I went to school , that used to be a school .
We decided to take out the stop lights eleven years ago because they used too much electricity - we just took them out . - you tell me you ca n't buy electricity for a long time for $ 52,000 ?
