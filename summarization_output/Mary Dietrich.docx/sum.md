**excerpts:**
you go there and around there like I think of Saegertown –
Just like-looking around Diamond Park here , so many churches , so many places that have always been here for as long as I ’ve been alive and a lot longer , and
I remember when they stone blasted that Stone Methodist Church back in the late ‘ 60s ‘ 70s , it was black , just because it had been there so long , and they sandblasted it to clean it ’s been there
– we were involved in a church in Waterford for over 20 years and I sort of always felt bad about that because … my parents would have loved to have had us come back while they were alive , but …
Walking downtown ! – I met my friends and we walked to like Woolworths and Murphys and whatever else was down there at the time .
Clothing stores , Weldon ’s , JC Penneys … There was another movie theater down there , but we always just went to the Academy .
Basketball games , high school – I liked school – I liked learning – that sounds corny , but – hey -you got ta see your friends !
The high school football games , basketball games , the courthouse
So , that building I think adds a lot to the town in this area of the Diamond Park .
The churches , Allegheny College – that was always a part of my growing up because my grandma worked there .
She managed the bookstore – til , well , when my grandfather was alive , they ran the student union grill , then he passed away and then I think she ran the grill for a little while longer , then she went to manage the bookstore until ’ 65
I ’m glad the police department is on Diamond Park .
During the good weather , summer , early fall Now , I love kids , I ’m all for having kids , but   you know , sometimes you feel a little – there ’s groups
Well , see , Diamond Park may be very safe , I just feel uncomfortable in it at night – I do And I ’m not saying it has , that ’s just how I feel .
Cause this is sort of a public place n’t ’ know that I am unsafe in reality
There ’s that new clothing store .
I thought it was in the mall .
I mean anybody could buy stuff there but it was n’t like out of this world . I like having Peebles there , like at Christmas time and I want to buy something , like not at Walmart .
And keep the YMCA going strong .   My older brother , when he was a teenager , worked at the YMCA and his whole life was YMCA .   I still get letters and notes all the time “ Everytime
Ok , to have a new YMCA – brand new , new pool , new basketball court .   I do n’t ’ know , I ca n’t think of anything .
Oh , yeah - I have a couple friends who go early in the morning whenever they open Now maybe in the middle of the day it ’s not so crowded , I do n’t know .
But things that could have happened in Wichita .
Except one time – ummm – I think it was right there where those trees are !
I think so – Mary Sue Prather was my friend and we were down town , a bunch of us , and her dad ’s office , he was a lawyer , he worked there , it was a brick building , and it went down –
It was a Saturday , and I was just like , and my parents knew him , and I was like , I just thought we were all going to be arrested , but it was Mary Sue –
