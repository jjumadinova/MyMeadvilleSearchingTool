**excerpts:**
Well I think that the transit system is excellent . Now that I 'm a senior I have a free bus pass to the city bus and share a ride , for two dollars one way in Meadville and I have n't driven a car in eleven years .
And also , I really appreciate Chaps and Journey Center because they have made a quantum leap in my recovery of my mental illness . Before I came here my mental illness was very personal and after i came here
they said that 's really unusual to have such a good system you say you live in a rural area , and I 've been told by my mental health services that Meadville has the best services of um , a lot of places .
I lived in quality living center for a year and a half and when I needed their services they were excellent , very supportive they provided transportation so that I could come into town and take this dialectical behavior therapy classes , which lasted several months .
And I appreciate that sharing of communications and socialization .
Well my two of my classmates from second grade on live in Meadville , and we still get together ,
We 've been best friends over 60 years
At least once a week .
Mostly my mental health services .
My therapist .
Gave me an application for Park-Side Commons which he felt like I 'd be independent from quality living center . pause
Mm ... Second Saturday .
Well that 's a bunch of vendors at the Market House , but they also have entertainment and projects for children on the second Saturday . On the other Saturdays its vendors for produce . But on Second Saturday it 's more comprehensive to the community .
Yeah I think it 's like from eight to two and then they have Meadville Friday , which is for Friday evenings .
I do n't know I do n't go ...
I think there 's food and ...
pause Journey Center .
Because they 're a certified club house , indiscernible club house , which means we have an international networking ... and so we get impressions , and strengths and weakness from all over the United States . but I know that it 's an international organization .
In fact a similar reason I 'm not living in Southern California now .
Yeah it is .
I would say Second Saturdays and the , I ca n't remember the title of that program when they were having that series of presentations last summer but I think just , the college students , and their advocacies as a community .
Women 's services
Mental health in Meadville , um , there was one about um , violence .. about when you should call somebody , I ca n't remember the title of that presentation . pause
No it 's been a good year .
they are very purposeful and uh , and they um , have a lot of out reaches like taxes and the library does taxes too , and I 'm only about two blocks from the library
Yeah . pause
But if you , I 've lived in , I graduated nursing school in New York State , moved to Southern California ' 69 to ' 88 , worked in Ohio , New York , California , and Pennsylvania nursing
ight because they 've lived here all of their lives . pause
pause Well that they have ... through their presentations and seminars and services they provide they have uh , um , very extensive outreach to the community .
Uh yeah all the , all the college students and ... active aging , and Journey Center , Chaps . pause
Sure , nice meeting you .
Now what board are you on I 'm on the advisory board .
If it 's got ta be big it might as well be cheese .
