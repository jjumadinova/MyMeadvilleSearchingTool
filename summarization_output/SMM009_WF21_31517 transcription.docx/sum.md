**excerpts:**
Its only like my second year of living in Meadville I was actually born in Franklin .
My Grandma , and school too .
Administration Security
Uh , the people , they have always been , uh nice like they tell you where to go because I ask them directions all the time - they seem pretty friendly and willing to help .
Well , if I was n't too far away , if I was on , cause I 'm on Luther ? road , if I got like closer or on a bus route that I could go up there that much then I would be ..
Yeah a little bit its far away to me
Well they run up to Northgate - and you have walk all the way up to Northgate to go in the other direction - so that 's why I found a shortcut , you can go down this great pathway that I found .
The book store , I love books and I love to go read , and the Library too , they have some very nice fiction books upstairs .
At DEP-Environmental Protection , Market Street
A little bit , I mean , I found some friends in school right now , but they 'll be going away after they graduate , so ... But we have a group chat going on right now
I think I would have to leave - yeah , there 's not too many jobs around - there 's jobs but , I have family out in California .
Uh , Affordable homes I guess
The Chinese food - I 've gone a few times - I 'm a foodie so I to go find the best Chinese food - The one up in the Plaza area that is pretty good .
