**excerpts:**
I love the restaurants in the area . and I like all these different kinds of restaurants .
Like the variety of food at my restaurant [ Cannon ’s Chophouse]. There ’s sandwich shops , there ’s all these little eateries and diners and stuff that are pretty cool
Favorite place to eat would probably .. taco bell laughs that ’s just realistic
I do n’t know . I like the community , like all the people that I see and meet everyday
That ’s pretty much mostly where you can find me .
Mmm I do n’t know . Maybe partying with all the college kids , that one night that I did .. Probably just walking down the street everyday making friends . That ’s what I like .
My job and not much keeping me here honestly . I just like the friends I made here
Like , a homeless program where we did n’t have to worry about shelter or like when our next meal was .. Something to help out the homeless because cops and everyone else in the area is just bullies to us
Like they literally come into the woods after us and tell us to pretty much drop everything we ’re doing and get out , with no place to go to to begin with . n’t know people in the community .
Good looks . I do n’t really know how else to answer ..
The night life is just .. If you walk down Main St at about 11 o'clock to 2 am you ’ll know exactly what i ’m talking about
ehh its like all the trouble makers came out and they …
Scout ’s honor .
It ’s hard to hang out with people when you 're only on a 3rd shift basis . Everybody 's asleep and like 1 of 5 people that ’s actually awake in town . They need more things for people to do on a 3rd shift basis .
Like jobs , like more jobs . Because everywhere is closed in the morning . As a cook , I ca n’t work first shift , because i ’m working second shift , I ca n't just work all day and then ..
I would like to see like , I do n't know maybe like an arcade or something
like , half a restaurant . Kind of like a Chuck E Cheese but like a lounge .
Cause that 's what I end up doing most of the time .
Like boys and girls clubs- have you ever been to one of those ? Like , back in the day that was awesome .
hell yeah
yeah other people could come too but i 'm sure it would be like for twenty somethings at like 3 am . Just like have a place for people to go to escape their lives for a while . Have it be part coffee shop or something
I mean , a restaurant .
Nah … I do n’t think so .
laughs sounds like fun
yeah , that would be cool
Maybe . If I worked there , yeah .
This warm weather
No , I stayed outside of Meadville , I worked in Meadville but stayed outside until like March and then moved into town
Luck that I ended up here in the first place
The leaves .
I do n't like the winter time because the trees look like death and are creepy . It ’s weird .
I guess , maybe .. I do n't know how to answer that one .
Investing in the youth
In a town like this , the kids are gon na end up with everything eventually anyway , so probably like better schools and programs for people to get .. out and away from the whole criminal element
Just have lots of programs and counselors that actually like counsel
one of the problems are the people that just do their jobs for the money to collect a paycheck but these kids barely get by . Kinda like how .. ( inaudible .. darn ! )
It matters to everybody . I mean , one day i 'm not going to be around and my kids will have everything . and they ’re going to have to deal with their own problems eventually
Yeah , they should n't have to worry about like , kids fighting and .. I ’ve seen a lot of that lately .
Anywhere from 15 to like 40
I do n't know , it ’s just so available , it ’s ridiculous Hell , you go to the bathroom on Chestnut and there 's people peddling it in the bathrooms
Does n’t matter , there are enough of them .
Like , just a place where you can go sit and watch tv , get out of school , do some homework , just being in your own bubble for awhile and meet up with other people that are doing the same thing
It would be nice
oh yeah ! Have like computers where you can go study or learn about all your programs
But you do n't , you would n’t need that because technology ..
I do n't want my kids to have to be scared every time they go out because people are whiling out and acting a fool or fighting in the park because they are twenty somethings that do n't know how to grow up
I would .. I do n't know . GPS on their phones , I guess .
I do n't know , get a red alert button they could press if they 're in trouble
any of the above ? I mean if somebody was attacking my little girl the fire department could show up with their axes and spray them down with the water hose
Job opportunities
Not exactly , just more stuff for people to do , ways to earn money without having to do so much at the same time .
I want cheaper apartments so that people can have one job and be able to stay in them
A waterpark !
Because who would n't want to go out and go on a bunch of waterslides and have all these little kiosks where you would like earn all of these trinkets . I just think that would be cool
I just imagine a water park around here
Better sidewalks
To get around , because i 'm almost constantly falling into traffic
Better , smoother sidewalks
Mmm .. that 's about it , community outreach programs I mentioned .
