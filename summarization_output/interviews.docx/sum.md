**excerpts:**
MY relationship began when I was a Bonner working at women ’s services . It made me get to know the area because … talking with people who were living there all their lives . Staying over the summer and get to do fun things .
Staying in Meadville has helped me in seeing the value of staying in a small town . But seeing the value of growing your experience over a long time , you can get so much out of it .
If this is where your heart is but your brain tells you to be somewhere else , I would listen to your heart because there ’s so much that you ca n’t see until you ’re in it .
FS EVSC classes took her downtown . I stayed over the summer and that was an awesome time . The best kept secret about Meadville is that the summers are wonderful .
When the year ended , I was like , “ and I wanted to be in a place where there were people that I loved . Meadville was the last place I ’d been really happy . I am going to fix things ! ”
The world is going to tell you you ’re They make you feel like you have to go do something But there ’s a lot of value in staying in a place that you have an understanding of or you want to deepen your understanding of .
The summers were definitely the thing that solidified the relationship , beyond service , attending events with community members . Ian Colley took his residents downtown . There are so many wonderful things to do here if you look for them and if you have people to connect you .
As a student , I was n’t constantly thinking about Meadville every day . I did service Saturday ’s and make a difference day , but , other than a church downtown , I did n’t get involved in any organizations downtown .
I would engage in safe spaces for Allegheny students like the market house . It felt like a nice half step into the adult world rather than moving everything and changing everything .
I chose to stay during the summer I was here and that ’s when I fell in love with Meadville . I decided that I would stay here for a year or two as a transition time . It ’s going to be hard to make that transition .
It ’s such a small town that anyone can do anything . You can do anything you want in this town because there are so few people here . If you want to become mayor … it ’s not that hard .
“ As a student , I was n’t thinking about Meadville every day . Taylor Hinton ’ 14 , now employed by the Community Wellness Initiative , expressed “ I stayed over the summer and that was an awesome time . The best kept secret about Meadville is that the summers are wonderful ! ”
It felt like a nice half step into the adult world rather than moving everything and changing everything , ” said Zach Cramer ’ 15 , the current AmeriCorps VISTA at the United Way of Crawford County .
They make you feel like you have to go do something Usually success is labeled to a big city and jumping in to something new and succeeding immediately or dealing with that struggle that you ’re expected to have .
n’t know ( Lexington , VA ) and I do n’t want to do that ever again . I need to be surrounded by excitement and adventures and new things , yes , but it ’s also about the people and having a connection to place .
