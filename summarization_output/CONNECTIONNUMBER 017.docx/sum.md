Oh what brought me to Meadville was that my parents wanted to move here because my grandma lives here .
Um ... I really like the changes of the seasons the seasons are pretty , it 's cool . laughs .
Um , probably my friends houses .
Oh you meant adding !
I thought you meant like adding on to the answer , okay . If i could add anything that , to Meadville I 'd probably add like , maybe an arcade or something . Like somewhere that people could hang out at .
Probably not . Not through high school .
Probably all the drugs in Meadville , laughs .
Can you , expand on that ? laughs
Probably diamond park .
my mom drives me to school and whenever we would come in early , like really early , she would drive around diamond park .
Ugh diamond park , um ... Probably um , there 's some old buildings that have n't been restored so , that probably would be something that could ruin the experience if they saw that .
Vocelli 's . laugh
I like their pizza a lot and I usually order it when I 'm with friends .
Uh Mongolian Barbecue , it 's really good . laughs
Yeah .   indiscernible laughs .
