**excerpts:**
They used to have street dances for the young kids that were like in middle school , high school . and they would close down Diamond Park , the road that went around . , it 's just a fun thing . and it was a warm feeling . I just think they need to come back and do some things like that .
My love of the MAC .
I think the MAC is a very special facility . I wish I had the staff like the YMCA does because there is so many things you could do here . But I started working here , it 'll be 35 years this April , and anyone that has ever worked at the MAC , no matter what capacity it is , I run into kids that used to work as a lifeguard or a concession attendant and they tell me ' this was our first job , and we loved it ' and you get bitten by the MAC . I think we could do a really fantastic job if we could afford to have like a program director , and a lot more positions than what we have . that 's in a supervisor position , and we have our staff meetings and
But I think the stores . A lot of the stores downtown You could walk in to the drug store , or jewelry store , and everybody knew everybody 's name . But everybody knew everybody . And I think back then everybody looked our for everybody .
I do love Diamond Park . It reminds me of the old movie Peyton Place , which is probably way before your time .
and I said to him ' sometimes as we 're growing up , people forget what the important things in life are . , that do good things , but unfortunately , there 's only so many people here that can donate money
I think if Meadville could go and make the downtown , like I love going into the bank . I think that is a great place to go and look and shop .
I think it 's different . People are friendly when you go in there . I have to be honest with you , I have n't been in there for a while . But when they had the coffee shop in there . Do they still have it ?
, they have a candle store and you can see them making the candles and things like that . I 've always wanted to go to the New England states , and I envision the stores like that up there .
I hate to say this , but I do not like Walmart . and I feel bad , a lot of times I go to Kmart even if I have to pay more because I think when Kmart goes out , Walmart is gon na be the only thing here . But if you could get like a Target , a Kohls , somebody to come in . Even here , we sell just a few things , we used to have a pro shop that sold hockey equipment , figure skating stuff and swimming stuff . Stuff like that .
and it 's definitely your family and your friends And there 's not somebody staying home . We had , not so much right now , but there for a while we had quite a few fathers that were stay at home dads and the wives worked .
I can remember when my husband and I were first married , he always worked second or third shift , and I did n't work until all my kids were in elementary school , and that s when i started here .
Have you talked to your girlfriend about this ?
and I ran into 6 people , 6 young people that used to work here at the funeral I said I just love seeing your family pictures on FB .
There 's a lot of stories that could be told . That 's what I love about this place . And I mean , and just as you think that nobody that could come and ask you something that you 've never heard of , it happens .
Did I ever tell you about the fish ? Well the parks and rec had playgrounds .
Yeah . The one that they put the rocks on .
I mean he was just the cutest thing and The kids were out on the ice , he ran out there and just flung this thing . Everybody just screamed because they thought it was the real thing . He said ' I will never do another thing ' .
He had one of the girls go in the bathroom , he gave he a quarter to get it . He was something .
