**excerpts:**
, I love how it 's , it 's it 's down to Earth I 've grown up here for my whole life and really love that lifestyle .

Um ... I probably one of my most favorite memories is uh , get getting my first communion um ... at it was at saint mary 's here in Meadville it was a very , very fun time .
Um , and also it 's easier to find clubs to join and other things to provide service to others .
um ... I think ... what would make things here a li ... living here easier would be ... uh ... if it was just easier maybe to get out , and to do more community service so hat the community can grow as a whole .
I would say uh Baldwin eynolds house is definitely a great place of history . uh , th the history and the ... great things that Meadville has to offer .
so if you , if those things are kind gone than it just seems too ... make Meadville seem ... blah .
during Pat 's sentence Yeah ... yeah
Um , I say community service is a great thing . you know I think it 's great to introduce more community service opportunities into Meadville .
uh , I experienced a lot of joy growing up in Meadville and I 've noticed you know like you look to Erie or Pittsburgh or the other bi , big cities and people have to continually worry about their safety but here you do n't have to .
Meadville for a lot of people to be more open um , I notice you know throughout the past century if you look into history people seems to kind of , be closing themselves off from each other
Mm , hm .
