**sum:**
**excerpts:**
I So yeah , if you um there 's a ton of different ways to get involved . So um we can talk about that too .
And then there was an absence of non market authority for it muffled . but it 's a little antiquated for this kind of thing .
I Yes . mhm but yeah I mean this is a great way to get involved . And so it 's coming out of the rebuild and so are
Overlapping talk government sanction thing or that just people organized person organized thing
I This My Meadville project ?
the- the
The redevelopment authority is a government it 's the same way the market authority is kind of under the city umbrella um but like we 're actively working to get something else on board like we 've had one of the council members join the leadership team recently like um
Now is there like something that you 're just using for your own or is it something like a poster ?
they take out the whole thing right so if you talk about certain things then they 'll say ok that fits this theme of what people are talking about . and we 're like hey but that 's up to you
, I know someone uh zoning board , I know the democratic party here , and stuff not the head of it the office where the democratic party of Meadville muffled Minute 306 I do n't want to overstate personal connections and you know what I mean is all
I Ok , no I mean so yeah
So is there a right answer or should I start with like it was a misty afternoon in May 1991 when I was born or should I try that ?
I laughs   Well we do have some uh uh muffled so uh Jack and Marv .... well you can answer them all together you could just be part of the conversation , Jack what is your last name ?
Muffled so technically my first name is John
I mean but no one calls you John
ight but I mean
I No it 's however you wanna , Marv what 's your last name ?
I Cool um so you 've been in Meadville for a long time
Yeah this is year 26
I Ok So did you always live in the city
yeah well West Mead but right up from the hospital up Leighton oad right up there
I Yeah , and do you live around there now ?
No so technically we live in an apartment right behind McDonald 's but we just purchased a house .
I eally ? Congratulations , wow .
We 'll be living on Column , right below the college
I Yeah , cool . That 's a nice neighborhood .
It 's a nice neighborhood , it 's got it 's since it used to be like an all Allegheny apartments and stuff too it 's really turning into more like younger families moving in
Yeah , because the college changed the way their living arrangements were on campus and stuff so like now you have to stay there unless you have like certain privileges your senior year , and that 's like the only time you can move off campus in the college
So now they move like families in there , it 's really awesome
Cuz there was even , there was even a house that two of my friends had lived in that was like a six seven person apartment that 's now for sale a whole house . " ok that 's not going to be seven college kids living there
I The one on Column that has like stairs that go up yeah I 've had friends that live there
I was going to say , I feel like
If you went down I spent my last two years of college at Allegheny so I graduated from
I ok what year ?
I now have to study journalism like tv production like um everything yeah and that was my last 8 credits , it was kind of a let down
I So were you Comm arts
Communications and political science uh political science was my minor but that 's but I was like I do n't want to spend that much more money plus the scholarship you get for being from Meadville you get like a $ 10,000 scholarship
I Oh really ?
Yeah for each year for two years if you 're like from the area it 's like you just through an endowment but I was like cuz they were like " you have to live on campus " and I was like " uh excuse me
I So uh mar you said you been living here for a year
A little bit over do n't you think
This summer will be two years so
I So where were you before
Clarion at Clarion College
I Did you guys meet at Clarion
Attended at Clarion laughs
I Yeah but when you were in the Clarion area , that when you
Well he came he was going , he 'd already gradated , and we met and um I was still living in Clarion and he came up there for muffled
I That 's funny because this project used to be called Heart and soul anyways laughs that 's cool so uh you 've been here for you 've been living in town for a year and a half
Yeah we lived on park ave at first and then that February , we moved down to the apartment we 're in now we 've been there since
I And so you were from Clarion
I am not
Yeah her situations a little more
I was born in Clearfield I have lived in muffled ridgeway and uh waynesboro and Pittsburgh
I ok
And you lived in Connecticut or Deleware
I Yeah so now you 're
Went to Erie college um and I lived there throughout college and then even like my senior year I took classes muffled
that 's really big and stuff we 're hoping to get an opportunity to go back somewhere and finish her degree or do something else they have a program too at college for women overlapping talk
Yeah that would be really awesome
Cuz like I do n't know how
I Yeah
the thing works with the Meadville scholarship I do n't know if you have a certain amount of time to get there or what
probably I 'm not sure , I think you have to be a resident
This would be a big deal especially with where we live she could walk everyday to the college
I Yeah Column 's right there I know a psych professor that lives on Column street . who has a young kid
My favorite professor I ever had lives on Column too , uh professor Christy-Searles
I oh yeah yeah
Yeah he was awesome
I Well he uh did you hear what his plans are ?
I mean this guy has done everything and like can do anything and that 's why it 's so remarkable and he had like a degree from MIT , he had a degree , he 's working on his doctorate he might have completed by now
I Yeah so he is leaving Allegheny and he 's gon na go to be a Buddhist monk
That does n't surprise me he 's done research with   overlapping he has done something
I It 's crazy just like ok bye
One of his research projects is like community of monks somewhere it might have been south america I think it was I mean he like lived with them for six months that 's literally something I 've always thought of
We had a group of tibetan monks at clarion for
I Yeah they did one at Allegheny too
I That 's really cool
It was only like one credit but I just wanted to take
They actually take the sand and they have a ceremony where they like pour it into a river
Yeah so like what they do they destroy the whole thing after they made it and then they take it to a river and it does n't matter how much effort you put into something it still
I Yeah like permanence and yeah and detachment
I guess that there was some um monks that came up to allegheny they ` were up here for about a week but they did the same thing they like i saw people later and they were like look and they like and they had little vials of the sand
Did they give them or did they take them
I I think they were like giving them and I was like that 's cool but like does n't that defeat the point is n't it supposed to like you 're not supposed to keep it cuz like you 're yeah it 's supposed to but anyways
I um
That 's like a funeral with all the incense I mean we have celebrations of death just like we celebration of life
I So I 'm wondering what do you love about Meadville
I But it 's what that was what you felt from your perspective , that how you viewed it
I That 's great that 's really cool . What about you , what do you love about Meadville ?
I mean it 's not far , but like everyone was graduating now people were moving and I 'm here like I wanted to move here and wanted to move in with him and then there 's the whole thing in Meadville I 'm
I Yeah for sure
I He 's great , let me tell you
Well I thought that was kind of cool also understood I was like I know way more people than I thought I did like
I So I think I know what brought you to meadville , why do you stay here ?
I Would you agree Jack
But Voodoo has some bands that overlapping
I cool
I He 's the manager of northwest state , it 's over by the Marc
I No that 's valuable
I And that 's created by like one person , spearheaded by one person with help with a couple others that like want to do this he just started it .
I Jason Zackle , started the website
He 's been doing a lot of stuff you mentioned your son growing up in a place where there 's always something to do and he can have something to do .
In other words we ran into people we knew there was other people we did n't necessarily know " oh we 're getting through to the same person , you know drinking the same thing .
Oh I wanna get out of here and I 'm like coming from someone whose lived here less than two years . it 's muffled so the parks shut down and they were all just going to get together and set up a table
