**excerpts:**
, like there 's not a whole lot of crime going on . like there 's the movies , mov- movie theatre , Hank 's , and Casey 's , just the whole , just all those left to do , Diamond Park .
What matters ? What matters to me most , uh , probably uh , the people , I 'd say . I do n't think the town would be the same without the people that live in Meadville .
My en- My entire life , I 'd say .
Probably uhm , like they tore , they took the playground down to like , you know what I mean , like down by Allegheny highland park . Is that what it is ? I put , I remember like as a little kid playing down there a lot .
Well , I was , well I am in a high school , so mainly my parents . Just living there generally .
What brought me here ? Well , well , kinda just my parents . My parents moved here and uh , yeah . Just never moved out .
Why did I stay ? Main- Mainly 'cause I just , well like my entire family , really I should say , just liked the town of Meadville in general really .
Kinda probably going back to what I said before , about [ unknown ] like the people that live here , just like , just like the neighbors , people , the people in school , the students , teachers and stuff .
Yeah , a friendly community .
Make staying here easier ?
and there are a lot of things to do . But like if , like if you could add more things to do . Like , I do n't know , I do n't know what you could add considering those already a good , pretty good amount of stuff
Captures the spirit of .... probably like uhm like the sports teams , like Meadville Bulldogs and like all , like all , like all the students come out to all the games and stuff just like really support the team and show a lot of spirit for , spirit for the team in general . Allegheny College as well , like , like Allegheny College is in Meadville , and like having a college in Meadville , which is n't that very big of a town .
And also some of the things that are around here , like the Diamond , th- the Diamond were- were n't here , Diamond Park it probably would n't feel like Meadville anymore if that was n't there .
But , if the peop- if the people were there Because they would n't hav- because there would n't be a whole load of new people . If the people that lived in Cambridge were still there .
I 'm not saying they do n't matter , I 'm just say- Like if you took out like , like the town hall for example , like it obviously that 'd have an effect in it , but I 'd s- but I 'd say the people m-
and like try to keep a whole load of crimes and bad things out of the , out of the town .

I was never huge on sports like I played basketball for a little bit
everywhere you go you can learn , can learn something differently and do something differently . And I feel like the way Meadville does like teaches athletics and music and any other extra-curriculars like clubs and other things like that
but I do n't have a whole load of knowledge about like how the other like schools work , like how Conneaut or Cambridge , as you said , like how they function to like actually like put it into words .
not a whole lot of stuff going on there . I have n't been to a whole load of the stores ,
