**excerpts:**
Okay , I 'm Melanie Cosdon , I 'm 13 and I go to Meadville Area Middle School
Um .. I do a lot of the arts , i act a lot . I sing and I dance . I do n't like to draw or point , i 'm not very good at it but i like ceramics .
Well i have an 18 year old sister . And she 's going to college this year . I kind of learned a lot from her . I live with my dad . He shows me broadway shows and yeah , that 's how i really got into theater .
Yeah , yeah .
she 's a therapist and has her own practice .
Yeah and she 's certified to teach yoga .
I think like mid august , i 'm not sure
Well during a school day , i like to wake up at 650 but its usually like 7 o'clock , 710 am and i walk to school most days Sometimes i have lie extra curricular activities or like i m on student council and have meetings .
I 'm doing a couple camps like creativing landscapes . I m also doing Camp Notre Dame , which is more traditional . Canoeing , bow and arrow , stuff like that .
Yeah , trying .
and sometimes you 'll be allowed on certain websites and some are blocked . Even youtube is blocked but there 's a way to get around that . People found sneaky ways .
And , i like going to the really cheap movies , because it 's just a fun thing to do and it might not always be a good movie Consider yourself lucky to have never been in a movie theater with me because we 're really obnoxious .
I love when that happens
Sometimes I like to bike to the top of the parking garage and look around .
Yeah , that 's the one , it 's a lot of fun .
Well I have a regular smartphone . And we have a computer at home and it 's so old . I feel like it 's one of those big box ones from the 90s and its very angry a lot .
We have an xbox that connects to our tv and we play videogames on there . But mostly i 'm on my phone .
I know people who do but we use the kinect to dance and do sports on it .
Very very often , i usually have my phone on my person all the time , like now . It makes me feel safer to have it , you feel more connected with people .
I do n't really use the computer too much but the occasional game . I watch TV probably and hour and a half to two hours a day . and my phone all day .
I like to watch buzzfeed videos and i have the buzzfeed app on my phone . And I have a lot of social media on my phone like snapchat and instagram .
I use instagram the most and i do n't think email counts but i have that .
I do n't think enough of my friends are online , i know my sister has it but that 's like , twitter is more her , its older . And facebook is just like , my parents use it , so i do n't .
Benefits are , its easier to make plans , just a quick text away or a snapchat throughout the day . you do n't know if they 're going to call back or not . or like there 's definitely like cyber bullying and all that stuff .
We have like all of that Amazon videos too .
Oh definitely stranger things .
Its a bit dated but Buffy the Vampire Slayer , i 'm a very fantasy , mystery type person , that 's also the books i read .
Sometimes you 'll feel like " it 's breaking , what do i do ? I 've never dropped my phone in water and had to put it in rice my sister has though . My dad once had his tablet run over .
Well the computer is in the upstairs study . And my sister usually uses that one for school work when she was in high school . My dad brings his tablet with him to work .
The really old laptop is floating around somewhere in the house . My mom has a newer laptop that she uses at her office .
Oh yeah , but sometimes i 'll be sneaky and say that i 'm leaving it out and my parents will be like " So you did have it in your room " and i 'll say i got up in the middle of the night or morning .
" hey look at funny things " .
I think that i 'm using it the regular amount for kids my age and that kinda scares me because i know i 'm on it kinda a lot .
I have the buzzfeed app that keeps me updated and has some quizzes and games that i enjoy . I do n't really have any games on my phone because i 'm very low on storage . I have a lot of music on my phone .
Because like , this school year we were allowed to have our phones on us so long as they were on silent or turned off completely . At the end of the school year after the award ceremony , where they give like honors and stuff and
I do n't like Spotify or pandora or websites like that . I usually have my phone on a play app . I buy the music and then put it on my phone . Or I get some illegal music apps or download it right off of youtube .
I 'm not a very pop music type of person so like , in the high school on friday , sometimes they 'll play music between classes . Usually its more popular songs or the ones at school dances .
It 's just a wide range of functionalities that instagram does . It has stories now which i do n't use , i find it a bit tedious . they 're trying to take over more sites .
But they 'll be like " look at this cool rock " or " this tree is weird " things like that . Instagram is more like a picture app for if you did something cool
A lot i guess . You want people to know what you 're up to and when you 're doing cool things .
I post things about my birthday or someone else birthday , Last day of school .
I guess I create a lot of my own content . I get irritated with people who just post quotes or something and stuff like that . There are other people who really like to do it for attention and will post hints .
Oh yeah .
You can really get good feeling from seeing the clothes I wear and what I do . Or like , I post updates on shows i 'm in like " we work real hard on this , come check it out " . So definitely
I 'd like to think i am . I do n't know how to put this , like not being fake online . The main thing is try to be you doing , just cause , like trying to make it look natural .
I think people would probably be less narcissistic because there 's a big thing about followers and likes on a picture . " I did n't get too many likes on this picture , i should take it down because people do n't like it .
My family does n't really have those modern social media apps . I know my grandparents have facebook and that 's how they communicate with my sister sometimes .
I think Meadville is good at supporting local businesses or projects like Grow Meadville who had local bands and art shows . I do a lot of my art in the market house over the summer and that was fun .
Yeah , i think they should because it 's a good way to catalog your memories each day . Yeah there are pictures but it 's better to show people .
I do n't know . I do n't think i have the power because i m 13 and living in a very small city . But there are accounts that are making people more aware of things like wildlife research type things .
Success i think to me is , like , being , happy with how your life is going . I think that 's pretty much society 's version of success . I guess societies version could also be lie how many friends or how much money .
Not necessarily because like , if you 're happy with yourself , why would you need to show these pictures off . But it could be good , i mean ...
Yeah , honestly . Because like , it ll give you more of a feeling of what people are like and what type of effort they 'll put into what they 're doing .
Oh yeah .
I would like to be either a marine biologist or a space engineer .
Probably because like you said people are going back to make sure you 're not a garbage person .
I think its pretty good , i think they 'll cringe when they see me at this age but i 've also gone back and seen my hair cut and i m making weird faces .
Like fidget spinners
Every trend or fad that comes out is all " we should all do this " and after a month two , the perspective changes and everyone 's like " oh , it 's so weird " . and it usually is .
When i first got a smartphone , like a year and a half ago . I got my first phone when i was in like 5th grade . and that was like a slide up phone . so i painted the back with nail polish .
I was excited about all the different apps and i wanted to show people my life and what i was doing . And i wanted one because all the other people had one
like i know i 'm going to italy for a month in the fall , it 's so that when we 're away we can still do our work and it 's easier to be connected . Like we are a small city .
I think it 's also pretty advanced . I mean like , you guys have all the computers in the library and the TV in the gyms . Do you guys do a lot of work on the computers here ?
Well , there 's a positive effect because you can tell what people are doing and what things are in . You can be more connected which is a pro social media thing to say but cyber bullying is a thing at our school
