**excerpts:**
that I thought it was an attractive town .
I love the Market house on a Saturday morning , after I take some junk there , some recycling cans from my house to the recycling center into the junkyard sometimes I stop by there sometimes I buy something .
And I think I like that there is space to be used in Meadville that is not used .
The Commons-yeah , common spots why is n't it filled - Someone said yesterday that they 'd like to sit in that common spot that they do n't know where to find in Meadville . but how nice it would be to be in one spot

that all did very well in college and had a good academic base , and I also love my church because there is not another Unitarian Church like this with this sort of historic background going back to the holder of the Dutch land grant here , and there was actually a theological school here until may 70 years ago that had maybe 100 years in existence that is now part of the University of Chicago - the Meadville Lumbar Theology School .   and there 's a lot of sort of surface interaction , and
and I really wanted to get him a home town - so I knew that it was kind of in the middle , but it was also a good town for music and art cuz I 'd been coming to this town by chance - and I 'd even come to this church for Cuzzies Jazz Jam 's - I 'd tie in a trip here coming home from visiting my mom 's house
Um , so I came to Meadville because I go to Allegheny , but Meadville and being involved with people in Meadville is what made me stay that 's why I stayed .
It used to be too large and industrial , Talon Zipper had its origins here and had two or three different locations and Avtecs also went back a number of decades making man made fibers , and when those left , I think there was sort of a feeling , of boy so I expect the hospital is gon na remain viable for a long time .
Well I think we are actually stuck just like everybody else in places with half democrats and half republicans , I think the spirit is kind of bruised here like everywhere -
The Martin Luther King Dinner tomorrow is very a very integrated and wonderful celebration also the Northwest band that comes here and performs in the gazebo - that was given by a man who had a piano shop here , Buellen , and he specified in his will that the plans that he had laid out were not to be changed - that the town either took it or left it behind
but that 's one positive place that people seem to come from all over and sit in the same park together and listen to music
I think on all different ends of political spectrums you 've got people here who see Meadville as something big , People have big dreams for Meadville and um , and see it , and see it as as I do n't know ,
and um the great lakes are bring protected and the French Creek system , there is more and more land being acquired by trust or gift so that the uniqueness and the purity of that water system is a source of pride to the people here .

- we 're a county seat , we 've got the courthouse and this new annex to the Courthouse and that 's a a big part of our skeleton , and I 'm not so sure that I like that .
that 's a large part of why I decided that I did n't want to move , you know I 've been to a number of different UU Churches across the country whenever I 'd visit or for special convocations and I have n't found a church that is nearly as meaningful to me-now everybody might think that -but for me I could n't find anything worthwhile to move affiliated with the Church , I would really miss this place .

, we were one of , I do n't know if we were the first area to desegregate schools , but it happened early on when a petition was presented to Judge Church because he wanted his kids to go the school nearest his home and Judge Church
The Market house on a Saturday morning in the summer - if that were taken away it would n't be Meadville anymore for me .

I do know when the KKK decided to come here three or four decades ago and they wanted to stand on the Courthouse steps , and that was permissable freedom of speech , but I do know of the alternative of the community event and that was for everyone in the community to come down to the bicentennial cabin for a picnic - and uh , there was n't a whole lot of attendance at the KKK meeting .
So what 's the ideas behind them that you would like to see continue into the future .
but I know that there are probably a lot of efforts probably through students ' initiation to maintain ecological and energy saving initiatives , uh , inclusion of all students and the right to freely represent-uh-to feel safe on campus no matter who you are .
The theaters-movie theater and playhouses

I like the size of the town , you can get anywhere in 5 minutes .
and there 's and I just always have been a part of the Meadville where that is , because I have been here a short time , and

and then there was this just this kind of huge void and downtown was dead but I think its people are um excited about that , there are some great local businesses around here and a good focus on that right now .
Well , speaking of tax base , like you know that one building on the corner of park and Arch , the taxes were like nearly $ 4500 per year which you know is nearly $ 500 dollars a month .
ight and its just gon na , you know it takes more than a vested interest in downtown to make a business work

ight , I understand that .

any time I was n't at home or at work and even some of my work time I was just there
I would turn the gas station on Park Avenue into a Youth Center
Um that 's not their own home ,

Mine would be to take this division that 's everywhere and soften it .
and um this is working different places
