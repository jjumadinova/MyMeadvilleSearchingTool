**excerpts:**
I love that they have so many different unique shops in this area that they offer to Meadville . Different stores , that other areas do n't have -
I think in this area is that   you serve individuals with disabilities -
and I love the fact that I can interact with individuals with disabilities , listen to their thoughts and their choices and decisions and help them to reach their goals and successes and help them be very independent community members too .
I have a son who has a disability - and there were so many doors that were always closing for him , and I have always been very passionate about wanting to open those doors
Well , if I lived in this area - if I was n't already drawn into a mortgage elsewhere that I 'm already in and if my son was n't already so far along in his schooling , that would be another factor to draw me into Meadville .
And because I work here , I hear about all the organizations doing events in the evening time and on the weekends , which is an interest too .



Keeping businesses local so they do n't close-finding out what is maybe the problems for businesses that may be on the verge of closing and what can we do to help them stay open-tying more businesses together so there is no overlapping of services , but
To really get to know community members and welcome them-know what all the organizations are doing as a whole , what is your organization , what do you offer ?
