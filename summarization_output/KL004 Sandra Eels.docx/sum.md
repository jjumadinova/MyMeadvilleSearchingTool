**excerpts:**
and I have n't driven a car in eleven years - and also I really appreciate CHAPS and the Journey Center because they have help make a quantum leap in my recovery of my mental illness-with peer consult-before I came here And then CHAPS hosted a series of presentations on things last summer and I could go-like Women 's Services , and other mental health agencies - and And I 've been told by my mental health services that Meadville has the best services of a lot of places -
Well , two of my classmates from second grade on live in Meadville and we still get together , and we 've been best friends for over 60 years .
At least once a week
Mostly my mental health services
um , my therapist gave me an application for parkside commons when she felt that I could undertake independent living
um , Second Saturday .
Well , that 's a bunch of vendors at the Market House , but they also have entertainment and activities for children on the second saturday of each month - on the other saturdays And then they have Meadville Fridays on the first Friday of the month .
I do n't know I do n't go , but a friend told me she likes to go to it , I think there 's food and vendors .
the Journey Center , because they are certified by Clubhouse and which means that we are part of an international network and we gain impressions and strength and weaknesses from all over the US - we do n't get much international contact-in fact the Journey Center is the only reason that I 'm not living in southern California now .

um-Snow . ( laughing )

but I graduated nursing school in NY state , moved to southern CA in 69 to 88 and worked in OH , NY , CA , PA in nursing
Well , I 'm sure there is presentations and seminars that they have-very extensive outreach to the community
No , like all the College students and Active Aging and Journey Center .
