I guess to begin with, are you from Meadville?

R: I’m not originally from Meadville. I am from Buffalo, NY.

So, what brought you to Meadville?

R: Um, my partner and my job. Ya, I work up at the college in development so.

What do you think about the relationship between the college and the town?

R: Um, I think it’s pretty good. I think our students like to get involved in the community and there are some good programs going on. I think it’s pretty good, I would like to see more kind of involvement with the community from the College.I don’t know if that is through events or what not. I think it’s overall pretty good

Happiest memory of Meadville? Or moment?

R: I don’t know that’s a tough one. I love the summers in Meadville, there is a lot going on like the Thurston Classic was really cool we did that the other day. Um, I’m trying to think of what else, we have paddleboards so we go out to woodcock and you know just enjoy the outdoors and (?). So, I like that there’s besides downtown Meadville, there are outlying areas that can keep you busy

Ya, college kids are always like there’s nothing to do there, and I am like have you walked down chestnut street.

R: Ya, there is stuff to do, you just kind of have to look for it and be creative. I don’t know that’s what I think.

Do you think you are going to end up staying in Meadville?

R: Um, I would say probably for like a prolonged period of time. I could see myself definitely here for like the next five years, after that I am not really sure.

Is there anything that would make staying here easier?

R: Um, well I think lately, like the new coffee shop and new stores coming up I think that kind of adds a lot of hustle and bustle to the downtown area and I like seeing that because it kind of draws more people down here, and just helps the economy as a whole and businesses. So, I think as long as we keep that going, and see more restaurant and shops coming in that’s all good things happening.
