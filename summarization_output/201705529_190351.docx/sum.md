**excerpts:**
I 'd say what I love most about the city of Meadville is that it has all of the attractions and items of a much larger town , but it has a very small-town , family-friendly oriented community .
I am a teacher , so what matters most to me would be not only having a great education system for my children , but also an education system that I am proud to work in . That is what matters most to me about that .
My favorite memory would probably have to be the Crawford County Fair . That is something that I look forward to the most each year from the time I was 8 years old . So I would say my strongest memory is the Crawford County Fair .
We also have two children , so having a great family atmosphere and a family-friendly town was important to us as we raised our family . Our families grew up here in this area and we 're happy to be around them , and stay in a great community .
As I said my husband is in manufacturing , so seeing a good , solid base in the economy would be something that would make us stay here .
I would say , knowing the president of the Chamber , I think she 's doing an amazing job providing events and opportunities for both small and larger businesses within the community . Also making Meadville very community centered I think she does a great job of that .
I think something that I of course would miss a lot would be the Crawford County Fair , if it was n't here .
A strong education system obviously . So between a strong education system and also jobs that people can have that people can make a good honest living off of will keep people here , and keep the town thriving .
What draws us here and keeps us here is all the items of a large town but in a much smaller community oriented . I want them to be able to have all the great memories that my husband and I share .
I would probably go with newer buildings versus all the effort and time and money that it would take to restore a lot of these historical places .
